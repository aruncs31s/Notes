### Datatypes

```python
# 3 
print(type(2))
print(type(2.0))
print(type(""))
```


> [!success]- *output*
> ```
> <class 'int'>
> <class 'float'>
> <class 'str'>
> ```


### Variables 
*A variable in Python is like a little label you stick onto a piece of data so you can refer to it later*
Eg:
Consider , there is a program in which you have to use `13232132131` this number , its like everywhere in the program 
```python
something = 13232132131 / 2
anotherthing = something * 13232132131
```
sure you can copy paste it but checkout this version

```python
number = 13232132131
something = number /2 
anotherthing = something * number  
```

its like giving it a suitable name , so that you can use it by name rather than remembering its value. 


### Operators
1. Arithmetic

#### Arithmetic Operators
```python
a , b  = 1 , 2 
a + b  # 3 "#" is the single line comment
a - b  # -1  
a * b  # 2 
a / b  # .5 
a % b  #  1 
b ** 2 # 4
a // b # 0
```

#### Comparison Operator

```python
a, b = 5, 10

# Equal to
a == b  # False

# Not equal to
a != b  # True

# Greater than
a > b   # False

# Less than
a < b   # True

# Greater than or equal to
a >= b  # False

# Less than or equal to
a <= b  # True
```
#### Logical Operators

```python
x, y = True, False

# AND - True if both operands are True
x and y  # False

# OR - True if at least one operand is True
x or y   # True

# NOT - Inverts the Boolean value 0 -> 1 , 1 -> 0
not x    # False
not y    # True
```

#### Membership Operators
```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
name = "Arun"

# IN - True if value is found in sequence
2 in lst       # True
"run" in name  # True
5 in lst       # False

# NOT IN - True if value is not found in sequence
5 not in lst   # True
"y" not in name # True
```

#### Identity Operators
```python
m = [1, 2]
n = [1, 2]
p = m

# IS - True if both variables point to same object
m is p    # True

m is n    # False (same values but different objects)

# IS NOT - True if variables point to different objects
m is not n  # True
```

```python
print(m is n) # False , different objects even if values are sae
print(m == n) # True same value even if different objects
``` 

#### Bitwise Operators

```python 
a , b = 1, 2  # 01 , 10

''' Bitwise AND 
  01
& 10 '''
a & b  # 0

#Bitwise OR
# 11 
a | b  # 3

# Bitwise XOR
 
a ^ b  # 3

# Bitwise NOT
# this might be confusing explain later.
~a     # -2

#  Left Shift (<<)

a << 1  # 2

#Right Shift (>>)
a >> 1  # 0
```

- [ ] explain biwise `not` üèÅ delete 

#### Assignment Operators
```python
x = 10

x += 3  # x = x + 3 ‚Üí 13
x -= 2  # 11
x *= 2  #  22
x /= 4  # 5.5
x %= 3  #  2.5
x **= 2 #   6.25
x //= 2 #  3.0
```


### Type Casting
```python
int(3.1) # 3 
float(3) # 3.0
str(10) # '10'
```

```python
a = 5 
type(a)
a = str(a)
type(a)
a = float(a)
type(a)
```

### Input , output , processing

```python
# input
a = input("Enter a number")

# output
print(a)
```

- One thing to note here that the default type will be a string from the `input()` and you may need to type cast it to work as expected for example 
```python
a = input("Enter a number")
if a==5:
	print("HI")
```
- this program will not work as expected (run and find out) (happens because `int(5)` is not same as `str(5)`)
```python
a = int(input("Enter a number"))
if a==5:
	print("HI")
```
