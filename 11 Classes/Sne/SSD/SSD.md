- $\phi_s$ = work function of the semiconductor
- $\chi$ = electron affinity (energy from vacuum to conduction band minimum)
- $E_{C}$​ = energy level of conduction band minimum
- $E_{F}$​ = Fermi level energy


Band Gap (Eg) needed for an electron to break free from its atom and become a free charge carrier.
**forbidden band**:(band gap) It is the range of energy that electrons in a solid **cannot possess**.



# Energy Band Diagram: A Scientific Explanation

Based on the provided diagram, this illustration effectively depicts the evolution of the electronic band structure of a crystalline solid, likely silicon, as a function of interatomic distance. The analysis can be broken down into three key regions and the fundamental quantum mechanical principles that govern them.

## Region 1: Isolated Atoms (Large Interatomic Distance)

On the right side of the diagram, where the interatomic distance is large, the electron states are discrete, corresponding to the atomic orbitals of an isolated silicon atom. The ground-state electronic configuration of a silicon atom is [Ne]3s23p2. This is represented by:

- The **3s orbital** with 2 electrons, occupying a distinct energy level.
- The **3p orbital** with 2 electrons, occupying a distinct energy level at a higher energy than the 3s orbital.

The diagram indicates that for a system of **N** atoms, these states are represented by **2N** states with **2N** electrons from the 3s orbitals and **6N** states with **2N** electrons from the 3p orbitals. Note that the 3p states are only partially filled.

## Region 2: Orbital Interaction and Hybridization

As the interatomic distance decreases, the wavefunctions of the valence electrons on adjacent atoms begin to overlap. According to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state. This interaction causes the discrete energy levels to broaden and split into a large number of closely spaced states, forming energy bands.

At a critical intermediate distance, the 3s and 3p energy bands merge completely. For silicon, this process is best described by sp3 **hybridization**, where the single 3s orbital and the three 3p orbitals combine to form four new, degenerate sp3 hybrid orbitals. This results in a single, broad energy band containing a total of **8N** allowed states. With **4N** total valence electrons (2N from 3s, 2N from 3p) available, this band is exactly half-filled.

## Region 3: Equilibrium Lattice Constant and Band Gap Formation

As the atoms are brought even closer to the equilibrium interatomic distance (5.43A˚ for silicon), the broad, half-filled band splits again into two distinct bands separated by a forbidden energy region known as the **band gap (**Eg​**)**.

- The lower-energy band is the **Valence Band (**Ev​**)**. It contains **4N** allowed states and is completely filled with the **4N** valence electrons at absolute zero temperature (T = 0 K). These electrons are bound within the covalent bonds of the crystal lattice and are unable to contribute to electrical conduction.
    
- The higher-energy band is the **Conduction Band (**Ec​**)**. It also contains **4N** allowed states but is completely empty of electrons at T = 0 K. Electrons in this band are delocalized and free to move throughout the crystal, thereby enabling electrical conduction.
    

The **Band Gap (**Eg​**)** is the energy difference between the top of the valence band (Ev​) and the bottom of the conduction band (Ec​). It represents the minimum energy required to excite an electron from a bound state in the valence band to a mobile state in the conduction band. The magnitude of this gap is the primary determinant of a material's classification as a conductor (Eg​=0), semiconductor (small Eg​), or insulator (large Eg​).

The diagram therefore provides a clear visualization of how the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics and atomic interactions lead to the characteristic electronic properties of a semiconductor material.


In a solid, many atoms are brought together, so that the split energy levels form essentially continuous bands of energies. As an example, Fig. 3–3 illustrates the imaginary formation of a silicon crystal from isolated silicon atoms. Each isolated silicon atom has an electronic structure 1s 2 2s 2 2p6 3s 2 3p2 in the ground state. Each atom has available two 1s states, two 2s states, six 2p states, two 3s states, six 3p states, and higher states (see Tables 2–1 and 2–2). If we consider N atoms, there will be 2N, 2N, 6N, 2N, and 6N states of type 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, and 3p, respectively. As the interatomic spacing decreases, these energy levels split into bands, beginning with the outer (n = 3) shell. As the “3s” and “3p” bands grow, they merge into a single band composed of a mixture of energy levels. This band of “3s–3p” levels contains 8N available states. As the distance between atoms approaches the equilibrium interatomic spacing of silicon, this band splits into two bands separated by an energy gap Eg. The upper band (called the conduction band) contains 4N states, as does the lower (valence) band. Thus, apart from the low-lying and tightly bound “core” levels, the silicon crystal has two bands of available energy levels separated by an energy gap Eg wide, which contains no allowed energy levels for electrons to occupy. This gap is sometimes called a “forbidden band,” since in a perfect crystal it contains no electron energy states.

We should pause at this point and count electrons. The lower “1s” band is filled with the 2N electrons which originally resided in the collective 1s states of the isolated atoms. Similarly, the 2s band and the 2p bands will have 2N and 6N electrons in them, respectively. However, there were 4N electrons in the original isolated n = 3 shells (2N in 3s states and 2N in 3p states).
