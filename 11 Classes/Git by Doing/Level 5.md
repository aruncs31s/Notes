# Level 5 
```dataview
Table without ID  file.name as "Name" , github as Link , status as Status, file.inlinks as Mentioned

In this level you are going to configure git properly.

## Lets recap 
Up until you have seen the following commands 
```bash
git status # to check the status of the repo 
git log # to see the commit history
git add # to add files to the staging area
git commit # to commit the staged files
git log # to see the commit history
git branch # to see the branches
git checkout # to switch branches
```

### Configuring Git
Let's start by properly configuring `git`. I have already explained `git log` in [[Level 3]] of this course. And you may remember the following, a single log entry may look like this. 
![[gitlog.png]]

![alt text](imgs_for_3/image-8.png)
You can see that , there are a few details like 
- Your name 
- Your email
- The commit message
- The date and time of the commit etc. 
But have you ever thought from where did the `git` obtains this information?.
if you type the following:
```bash
git config --get user.name
```
you will obtain the following
```
Arun CS
```
and to get the `email` run the following.
```bash 
git config --get user.email
```

```
aruncs31ss@gmail.com
```

I was able to get this because i configured it , when i installed `git`. 
In order to configure things like `name` and `email` , run the following

```bash
git config user.name "Arun CS"
```
For example if you want to change you name to something like "Dog", you can run the following command:
```bash
git config user.name "Dog"
```

![[gitconfig-1.png]]

This type of configuration is called `local` or `project` or `repo` level configuration. What i mean by that is that , look at the following example, 
![[localconfig.png]]
when i run 
```bash
git config --get user.name
```
it prints `Dog` , but when i change repo , or directory the name also changes. 
To make the changes `global` you should use the `--global` flag like this,

```bash
git config --global user.name "Arun CS"
```

> you can also get the `global` configuration like the following

So there are 2 types of configuration , and the are `global` and `local` and stored in `~/.gitconfig` and `.git/config` respectively.

- [ ] check this is true if not modify it.  üèÅ delete 
**FAQ: Where these name and mail id used**
- Others can easily verify who made the commit.
- And it is required for features like `git blame`, which shows who last modified each line of a file.


## Where these will be used?
You have already learned about `git commit` and `git log` in [[Level 3]] , right?. So when you do a `git log` you see see the following right?
- Your name 
- Your email
- The commit message 
![alt text](imgs_for_3/image-8.png)
We can use this `git log` and `git blame` to identify who made some specific 
For example you can check if someone named `zeidan` had ma
