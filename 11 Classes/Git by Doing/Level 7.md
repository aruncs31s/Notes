# Level 7 , Still Working ON.
```dataview
Table without ID  file.name as "Name" , github as Link , status as Status, file.inlinks as Mentioned
where file = this.file
```

## Lets recap 
Up until you have seen the following commands 
```bash
git status # to check the status of the repo 
git log # to see the commit history
git add # to add files to the staging area
git commit # to commit the staged files
git restore # to restore file that has been added but accidently deleted.
git log # to see the commit history
git branch # to see the branches
git checkout # to switch branches
git config # to mess with configuration
git pull # To Get Changes from the github
git push # To add you changes to the github
```
And you might  need to use most of them inorder to complete this level.
