Reviewing Matrix Transformations

I'm currently verifying the sequence of matrix transformations. The initial state is the 3x3 identity matrix, so I'm starting from a known baseline. My focus now is on understanding how each transformation affects the identity matrix, identifying the patterns emerging. I'm carefully analyzing the impact of each matrix operation to confirm the final result.

Deciphering the Rotation

I've made some progress, focusing on how the rotation affects the initial coordinate system. Assuming "z pointing normal to -x pointing normal" describes a rotation that orients the z-axis along the negative x-axis, I'm working with a rotation matrix that performs a +90-degree rotation around the y-axis. The resulting rotation matrix will transform the initial identity matrix, and I'm currently verifying if it aligns with the expected coordinate change.

Calculating Final Transformations

My current focus is calculating the final matrix transformation. I'm building upon the initial rotation matrix derived from orienting the z-axis to the negative x-axis. Using this result, I intend to determine how the transformation impacts each basis vector. Finally, I'll compare the output to the target output matrix to see if the overall sequence is correct.

Revisiting Coordinate Systems

My thinking has progressed to interpreting the rotations. Initially, I incorrectly assumed "z pointing normal to -x pointing normal" meant an orientation shift. Now I realize it's a rotation of the z-axis to the negative x-axis, using a rotation matrix of +90 degrees around the y-axis, as I've determined. Next, I will clarify this rotation by reviewing the calculated transformation.

Verifying Rotation Sequence

My focus has shifted to deciphering the specific rotation required. After reviewing the text again, I've confirmed that the correct approach requires a negative 90-degree rotation. The goal is to move the z-axis to the negative x-axis, using a rotation around the y-axis, and I now believe that a −90 
∘
  rotation about the y-axis is the appropriate transformation, as this aligns the original z-axis with the negative x-axis. I'm building a transformation matrix using these constraints.

Confirming the Y-Axis Rotation

I'm verifying the specific rotation around the y-axis, considering the requirement to align the z-axis with the negative x-axis. Using a rotation of -90 degrees about the y-axis, I'm confident that this transformation correctly maps the initial z-direction to the negative x-direction. Now, I will calculate the resultant transformation matrix.

Verifying Rotation Sequence

My thoughts have clarified the intended rotation.  The initial interpretation was incorrect; I now believe a -90-degree rotation around the y-axis is the appropriate starting point to orient the object's z-axis. With this matrix confirmed, I will start by verifying the rotation about the Y axis.

Interpreting Rotations

I've revised my understanding of the rotations. The crucial part now is interpreting "z pointing normal to -x pointing normal". I'm now leaning towards a -90-degree rotation about the y-axis to align the object's z-axis with the negative x-axis. I will now compute the transformation matrix based on this interpretation.

Re-evaluating Matrix Sequence

My thoughts have taken a turn, re-assessing the initial rotation and its effect on the basis vectors. I'm focusing on the intended transformations to ensure my calculations align with the desired orientation. The initial identity matrix represents the starting point, and I'm currently working to match my calculations with this baseline.

Verifying Rotation Sequence

Now, I'm verifying the 90-degree rotation around the y-axis, followed by a 180-degree flip around the z-axis. I believe that's the correct way to model the coordinate system change. Applying these transformations step-by-step to the initial identity matrix should produce the intended target matrix. I'm double-checking the resulting matrix and will verify the rotation sequence.

Verifying Rotation Sequence

I'm now confident in the -90-degree rotation about the y-axis, but a slight adjustment is needed.  The goal is for the z-axis to point to the negative x-axis. Using the -90 degree rotation will correct this.  Now I'll calculate the transformation to align the coordinate system.

I've determined the correct sequence of transformations. It involves a +90-degree rotation around the y-axis, which is then followed by a 180-degree rotation around the z-axis. The rotations' effect on the coordinate axes now align with my current calculations.

Verifying Transformations Sequence

I'm now certain of the transformations. A +90-degree rotation around the Y-axis aligns the Z-axis with the positive X-axis. Then, a 180-degree rotation around the Z-axis completes the transformation. The resulting matrix, reflecting these operations, is confirmed.

Analyzing Coordinate Transformations

I've re-examined the coordinate system rotations, focusing on the correct rotation matrix for the first transformation. The goal is to orient the z-axis to the negative x-axis, which I believe is achieved with a +90-degree rotation around the y-axis, followed by a 180 degree rotation around the z axis. I will check the vector changes and calculate the final matrix to confirm this sequence.

I've determined a clear rotation sequence. A +90-degree rotation around the y-axis is followed by a 180-degree rotation about the z-axis. The resulting matrix matches my expected outcome after checking each transformation.

# Rotation Matrix Sequence

## Given Rotations

1. **First rotation**: $90^\circ$ around the global $Y$-axis:
   $$
   R_y(90^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix} 
   0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
   0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
   -1 & 0 & 0 
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

2. **Second rotation**: $180^\circ$ around the $X$-axis:
   $$
   R_x(180^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & \cos 180^\circ & -\sin 180^\circ \\ 
   0 & \sin 180^\circ & \cos 180^\circ 
   \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
   1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
   0 & -1 & 0 \\ 
   0 & 0 & -1 
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

## Fixed-Axis Rotation (Global Frame)
$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_x(180^\circ) \cdot R_y(90^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & -1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
-1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & -1 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Local-Axis Rotation (Body-Fixed Frame)
$$
R_{\text{total}} = R_y(90^\circ) \cdot R_x(180^\circ) = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
0 & 1 & 0 \\ 
-1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 \\ 
0 & -1 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0 & -1 
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 0 & -1 \\ 
0 & -1 & 0 \\ 
-1 & 0 & 0 
\end{bmatrix}
$$
