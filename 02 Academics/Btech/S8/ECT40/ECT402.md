# Wireless Communication
- [[01 Academics/Btech/S8/ECT40/Class Notes]]

## Module 1
**Syllabus**
- Need for Multi carrier system
- Basics of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Multiple access for OFDM systems
- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
- Cellular concept, path loss and shadowing, doppler shift,
- Multipath effect
- Significance of diversity in wireless communication systems

### Need for Multi Carrier Systems 
The traditional Single carrier systems use only **single frequency to carry all data**. Multicarrier systems use **multicarrier modulation (MCM)** schemes by which the transmitted data stream is divided into **several parallel lower–bit rate subcarriers**^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/multicarrier-system].
