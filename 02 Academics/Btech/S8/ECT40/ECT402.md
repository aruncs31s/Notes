### Need for Multi Carrier Systems 
The traditional Single carrier systems use only **single frequency to carry all data**. Multicarrier systems use **multicarrier modulation (MCM)** schemes by which the transmitted data stream is divided into **several parallel lowerâ€“bit rate subcarriers**^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/multicarrier-system].
