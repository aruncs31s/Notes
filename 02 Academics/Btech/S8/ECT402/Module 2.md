## Path Loss

**Formula:**

$$
PL(dB) = 20\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)
$$

### Friis Transmission Formula

$$
P_{r} = P_{t} G_{t} G_{r} \left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} \right)^2
$$

## Free Space Propagation Model

Electromagnetic signals traveling through wireless channels experience fading due to various effects. However, in some cases, transmission occurs with a direct line of sight, such as in satellite communication.

**Key Points:**
- Used to predict received signal strength when the transmitter and receiver have a clear, unobstructed line-of-sight path between them.
- Satellite communication systems and microwave line-of-sight radio links typically undergo free space propagation.
