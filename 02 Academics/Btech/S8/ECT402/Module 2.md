- [ ] Free space path loss,
- [ ] Two-Ray model, Shadowing,

2.2 Statistical Multipath Channel Models (4): 
- [ ] Time-varying channel impulse response,
- [ ]  Narrowband fading,
- [ ] Wideband fading models, 
- [ ] Delay spread and Coherence bandwidth, 
- [ ] Doppler spread and Coherence time, 
- [ ] Flat fading versus frequency selective fading,

## Path Loss 

$$
PL(dB) = 20\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right)
$$

### Friis Transmission Formula 
$$
P_{r} = P_{t} G_{t} G_{r} \left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} \right)^2
$$
