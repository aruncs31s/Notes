# Path Loss and Shadowing
***Path loss*** is simply the weakening of a signal as it travels from transmitter to receiver.

***Shadowing*** is a slower, large-scale effect where the signal strength fluctuates because of obstacles like buildings, hills, or even a truck passing between you and the base station.
