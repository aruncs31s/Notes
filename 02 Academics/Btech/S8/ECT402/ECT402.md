## Important Topics

- [ ] Frequency Reuse & Capacity – derive reuse distance (D=R√3N), SIR vs N, capacity per cluster.
- [ ] Cell Splitting & Sectoring – triggers (traffic, QoS), effect on interference & handoffs.
- [ ] Trunking & Grade of Service – compute blocking with Erlang B; interpret offered traffic.
- [ ] Interference Types – co-channel vs adjacent; mitigation (reuse planning, filtering, guard bands).
- [ ] Fading (Small-Scale / Multipath) – Rayleigh/Rician basics; causes of amplitude variation.
- [ ] Doppler / Time Selectivity – calculate Doppler shift & coherence time for sample speeds.
- [ ] Outage Probability – Rayleigh outage P_out formula; fade margin meaning.
- [ ] Link Budget / Friis – step-by-step received power including antenna gains, path loss, misc losses.
- [ ] Diversity Techniques – selection vs MRC conceptually; macro vs micro examples.
- [ ] Equalization (Linear vs Nonlinear) – ZF, MMSE tradeoffs; when DFE/MLSE preferred.
- [ ] Cyclic Prefix / OFDM – orthogonality condition Δf=1/T_u; CP length criterion ≥ max delay spread.
- [ ] PAPR in OFDM – compute sample PAPR; list at least 3 reduction techniques with pros/cons.
- [ ] Channel Capacity – Shannon vs ergodic; when to use outage notion.
- [ ] Multiple Access Comparison – resource axis & key limitation for FDMA/TDMA/CDMA/OFDMA.
- [ ] Generational Evolution – one defining advancement per generation (1G→5G if desired).
- [ ] Ionospheric Propagation – critical frequency derivation; simple refractive index expression.
- [ ] Two-Ray / Path Loss Models – breakpoint distance and near/far region exponents.
- [ ] Trunking / Erlang (Reinforce) – second pass to solidify formulas & quick estimation heuristics.
