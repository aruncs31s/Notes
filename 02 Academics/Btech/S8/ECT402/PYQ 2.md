1. Define Grade Of Service (GOS) and Trunking.

### Grade Of Service (GOS)
- **Definition:** Measure of quality in telecommunications.
- **Key Point:** Probability of a call being blocked or delayed due to insufficient resources.
- **Indicator:** Lower GOS = better quality (fewer blocked calls or delays).

**Grade of Service (GOS):**
Grade of Service (GOS) is a measure used in telecommunications to describe the quality of service provided to users. It is defined as the probability of a call being blocked or delayed due to insufficient resources (e.g., bandwidth, channels) at the time of the call. A lower GOS indicates a better quality of service, as it means that users are less likely to experience blocked calls or delays.

### Trunking
- **Definition:** Efficient channel utilization in telecommunications.
- **Key Point:** Multiple users share a pool of channels, dynamically allocated as needed.
- **Benefit:** Optimizes resource usage and improves system capacity, especially with bursty or unpredictable traffic.

**Trunking:**
Trunking is a method used in telecommunications to efficiently utilize communication channels by allowing multiple users to share a smaller number of channels. In a trunked system, a pool of channels is dynamically allocated to users as needed, rather than assigning a dedicated channel to each user. This approach helps to optimize resource usage and can improve overall system capacity, especially in environments with bursty or unpredictable traffic patterns.
