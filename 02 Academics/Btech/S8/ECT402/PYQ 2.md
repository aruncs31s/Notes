## Ans 

### 1.  Grade Of Service (GOS)

> [!info]- Short Answer
> **GOS:** Probability of call blocking/delay due to insufficient resources. Lower GOS = better quality.
> **Trunking:** Dynamic channel sharing among multiple users from a common pool for efficient resource utilization.

- **Definition:** Measure of quality in telecommunications[^1].
- **Key Point:** Probability of a call being blocked or delayed due to insufficient resources.
- **Indicator:** Lower GOS = better quality (fewer blocked calls or delays).

**Grade of Service (GOS):**
Grade of Service (GOS) is a measure used in telecommunications to describe the quality of service provided to users. It is defined as the probability of a call being blocked or delayed due to insufficient resources (e.g., bandwidth[^2], channels) at the time of the call. A lower GOS indicates a better quality of service, as it means that users are less likely to experience blocked calls or delays.

#### Trunking
- **Definition:** Efficient channel utilization in telecommunications.
- **Key Point:** Multiple users share a pool of channels, dynamically allocated as needed.
- **Benefit:** Optimizes resource usage and improves system capacity, especially with bursty or unpredictable traffic.

**Trunking:**
Trunking is a method used in telecommunications to efficiently utilize communication channels by allowing multiple users to share a smaller number of channels. In a trunked system, a pool of channels is dynamically allocated to users as needed, rather than assigning a dedicated channel to each user. This approach helps to optimize resource usage and can improve overall system capacity, especially in environments with bursty or unpredictable traffic patterns.

### 3. Fraunhofer Distance

> [!info]- Short Answer
> **Formula:** $d_f = \frac{2D^2}{\lambda}$ = $\frac{2(1)^2}{1/3}$ = **6 meters**
> **Significance:** Boundary between near-field and far-field regions; beyond this distance, antenna radiation pattern becomes stable.

- **Formula:**
  $$
  d_f = \frac{2D^2}{\lambda}
  $$
  where:
  - $d_f$ = Fraunhofer distance
  - $D$ = maximum dimension of the antenna
  - $\lambda$ = wavelength of the operating frequency

- **Calculation:**
  - Given:
    - $D = 1$ meter
    - Frequency $f = 900$ MHz $= 900 \times 10^6$ Hz
    - Speed of light $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s
    - Wavelength $\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{900 \times 10^6} = \frac{1}{3}$ meters
    - Fraunhofer distance:
      $$
      d_f = \frac{2 \times (1)^2}{\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \, \text{meters}
      $$

- **Significance:**
  - The Fraunhofer distance marks the boundary between the near-field[^7] and far-field[^8] regions of an antenna.
  - Beyond this distance, the antenna's radiation pattern becomes stable and predictable.

### 4. Coherence Bandwidth

> [!info]- Short Answer
> **Definition:** Range of frequencies over which channel appears "flat" (non-selective fading).
> **Formula:** $B_c \approx \frac{1}{5\tau_{rms}}$ - inversely related to RMS delay spread.

- **Definition:**
  - Coherence bandwidth ($B_c$) is a statistical measure of the range of frequencies over which the channel can be considered "flat" or non-selective[^9], meaning all frequency components experience similar fading[^10].
  - It indicates the maximum frequency separation over which two signals will experience correlated or similar channel effects.

- **Relation to RMS Delay Spread:**
  - Coherence bandwidth is inversely related to the root mean square (rms) delay spread[^11] ($\tau_{rms}$) of the channel.
  - A smaller delay spread results in a larger coherence bandwidth, and vice versa.

- **Formula:**
  $$
  B_c \approx \frac{1}{5\tau_{rms}}
  $$
  where:
  - $B_c$ = coherence bandwidth
  - $\tau_{rms}$ = rms delay spread of the channel

- **Significance:**
  - If the signal bandwidth is less than the coherence bandwidth, the channel is considered flat fading[^12] (frequency non-selective).
  - If the signal bandwidth exceeds the coherence bandwidth, the channel exhibits frequency-selective fading[^13].

### 5. Total Bandwidth for Multi-Carrier Modulation (Non-Overlapping Subchannels)

> [!info]- Short Answer
> **Formula:** $B_{total} = N \times B_{sub}$
> Total bandwidth = Number of subchannels × Bandwidth per subchannel (plus guard bands)

- **Definition:**
  - Multi-carrier modulation divides the available spectrum into multiple non-overlapping subchannels, each carrying a portion of the data.
  - Each subchannel operates at a different frequency with its own bandwidth.

- **Total Bandwidth Calculation:**
  - For N non-overlapping subchannels, each with bandwidth $B_{sub}$:
  $$
  B_{total} = N \times B_{sub}
  $$
  where:
  - $B_{total}$ = total bandwidth required
  - $N$ = number of subchannels
  - $B_{sub}$ = bandwidth of each subchannel

- **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Guard Bands[^14]:** Additional bandwidth may be required between subchannels to prevent interference.
  - **Spectral Efficiency:** Lower than overlapping schemes (like OFDM[^15]) due to guard bands.
  - **Simplicity:** Easier implementation compared to overlapping subcarrier systems.

- **Example:**
  - If 4 subchannels each require 10 kHz bandwidth:
  - Total bandwidth = 4 × 10 kHz = 40 kHz (plus guard bands)

- **Applications:**
  - Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA[^16])
  - Traditional multi-carrier systems
  - Satellite communication systems

### 6. Peak-to-Average Power-Ratio (PAPR) in OFDM System

> [!info]- Short Answer
> **PAPR:** Ratio of peak instantaneous power to average power in OFDM signals. High PAPR causes amplifier saturation and distortion.
> **Reduction Methods:** Clipping, coding, tone reservation, active constellation extension, partial transmit sequences.

- **Definition:**
  - PAPR[^17] is the ratio of the peak instantaneous power to the average power of an OFDM signal.
  - It represents how much the signal power varies from its average value.

- **Mathematical Expression:**
  $$
  PAPR = \frac{P_{peak}}{P_{average}} = \frac{\max|x(t)|^2}{E[|x(t)|^2]}
  $$
  where:
  - $P_{peak}$ = peak instantaneous power
  - $P_{average}$ = average power
  - $x(t)$ = OFDM signal in time domain
  - $E[\cdot]$ = expectation operator

- **Problems Caused by High PAPR:**
  - **Amplifier Saturation:** Power amplifiers[^18] operate in non-linear region
  - **Signal Distortion:** Clipping and intermodulation distortion
  - **Spectral Regrowth:** Out-of-band emissions
  - **Reduced Efficiency:** Lower power amplifier efficiency
  - **Increased Cost:** Need for high-dynamic-range components

- **PAPR Reduction Techniques:**

  **1. Signal Distortion Techniques:**
  - **Clipping[^19]:** Limit signal amplitude to threshold value
  - **Peak Windowing:** Apply window function to reduce peaks
  - **Companding:** Compress large signals, expand small signals

  **2. Coding Techniques:**
  - **Block Coding:** Use error-correcting codes to avoid high-PAPR sequences
  - **Complementary Sequences:** Use sequences with low autocorrelation

  **3. Multiple Signal Representation:**
  - **Partial Transmit Sequences (PTS[^20]):** Partition data into sub-blocks with different phase rotations
  - **Selected Mapping (SLM[^21]):** Generate multiple candidate signals and select lowest PAPR
  - **Interleaving:** Rearrange data to reduce peak correlation

  **4. Probabilistic Techniques:**
  - **Tone Reservation[^22]:** Reserve some subcarriers for PAPR reduction
  - **Active Constellation Extension[^23]:** Extend constellation points to reduce peaks
  - **Tone Injection:** Add specific tones to cancel peaks

- **Trade-offs:**
  - **Complexity vs Performance:** More sophisticated methods offer better PAPR reduction but higher complexity
  - **Data Rate vs PAPR:** Some methods reduce data rate (overhead) for PAPR reduction
  - **BER vs PAPR:** Signal distortion methods may increase bit error rate
