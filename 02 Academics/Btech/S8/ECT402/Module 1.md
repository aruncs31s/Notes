## Introduction
- At their core, these systems use electromagnetic waves—radio, microwave, sometimes even infrared or millimeter waves—to carry signals across space without needing a physical connection.

```

- A transmitter takes your information (`voice`, `text`, `video`), converts it into an electrical signal, **and modulates it onto a carrier wave** (a high-frequency signal suitable for transmission).
- That carrier rides through the wireless medium—air, vacuum, sometimes even water.
- A receiver picks it up, demodulates it, and extracts the *original information*.

## Generations
Marconi transmitted **Morse code** signals using radio waves wirelessly to a distance of **3.2 KMs** in #1895

## WLAN
- within an area of building/school etc
- 2.4GHz Band
- the `phy` and `MAC` layer is specified by the IEEE802.11 standard

| Wi-Fi Standards Evolution | Standard | Max Speed   | Frequency | Year Introduced |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | --------- | --------------- |
| 802.11                    | 2 Mbps   | 2.4 GHz     | 1997      |                 |

## Bluetooth
- It also uses the 2.4GHz
- low data rate compared to wifi
- also short distance 
- uses radio waves
## PAN 
*refers to a network of devices connected within a small geographical area*
**eg**: [[#Bluetooth]]

## WiMAX[^1]

[^1]: WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a broadband wireless communication technology that provides high-speed internet access over long distances.
- Based on IEEE 802.16 
- 

### Wireless Spectrum allocation, Standards.

## The Cellular Concept
- It replaces the single big transmitter (high  power) transmitter with many low power transmitter(cells) 

### Making Call

```mermaid

```

- MSC -> mobile switching center , mobile telecommunication switching center
- Base Transceiver
### Frequency Reuse (Frequency Planning)
The design process of selecting and allocating channel groups for all of the cellular base stations within a system is called frequency reuse or frequency planning. It involves dividing a geographical area into smaller regions, called  cells, and assigning the same set of frequencies to different cells that are spaced sufficiently apart.

### Hand-Off
Q. What are the methods adopted for hand-off procedures

>[!Note] Hand-off

![[Pasted image 20250419190411.png]]
A hard handoff occurs when the old connection is broken before a new connection is activated

A hard handoff is essentially a “break before make” connection.

## Fading 
Q.  how does fading occur , derive the expression for doplar shift
 Fading refers to the variation in signal strength over time or space due to various interference effects
 

## Multiple Access
*It is the application of multiplexing*
