## 1. Channel capacity per cluster & total system capacity (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Channels per cluster = 7 cells × 10 channels = 70. Total deployed channel instances = 70 × 10 clusters = 700 (only 70 unique reused 10×). Spatial reuse multiplies capacity without extra spectrum.

---
## 2. Cell splitting & performance improvement (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Divides a large congested cell into smaller low-power cells reducing reuse distance so frequencies are reassigned more often. Benefits: higher capacity (more Erlangs/km²), lower blocking, improved SINR[^SINR], reduced handset Tx power. Trade-offs: more handoffs, higher site/backhaul/optimization cost.

---
## 5. Cyclic prefix role in OFDM[^OFDM] (3 Marks)
**Answer:** CP[^CP] copies last L_CP samples to front making linear channel convolution circular if CP ≥ max delay spread. Eliminates ISI[^ISI], preserves subcarrier orthogonality enabling one-tap equalization; adds overhead L_CP/(N+L_CP).

---
## 6. Average error probability vs outage probability (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Average error probability: expectation of conditional error over SNR[^SNR] PDF (long-term BER[^BER]/SER[^SER]). Outage probability[^OUTAGE]: P{γ < γ_th} (or capacity < target)—fraction of time QoS unmet.

---
## 7. Selection Combining diversity (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Picks branch with max instantaneous SNR: γ_out = max(γ_i). Rayleigh outage: P_out = [1 - e^{-γ_th/γ̄}]^L. Pros: simple/low power. Cons: lower gain than MRC; needs SNR measurement & switch.

---
## 8. Linear vs nonlinear equalization (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Equalization combats ISI by approximating inverse channel. Linear (ZF[^ZF], MMSE[^MMSE]): simpler, fixed latency; ZF noise enhancement, MMSE residual ISI tradeoff. Nonlinear (DFE[^DFE], MLSE[^MLSE]): better performance in severe ISI; costs complexity & potential error propagation (DFE) or exponential states (MLSE).

---
## 9. Ground wave propagation pros & limits (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Pros: beyond LOS via earth-following diffraction, reliable LF/MF coverage, maritime/navigation utility. Limits: strong attenuation over poor ground, inefficiency at higher f, large λ-scale antennas, narrow bandwidth, high noise susceptibility.

---
## 10. Critical frequency & MUF relation (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Critical frequency f_c ≈ 9√(N_max) (MHz). MUF[^MUF] for incidence angle θ: MUF = f_c / cos θ = f_c sec θ ≥ f_c. Shallower incidence (longer path) increases MUF.

## 11. (a) Evolution of Wireless Generations: 2G → 3G → 4G → 5G (8 Marks)
**Answer:**

| Generation | Approx Era | Core Services | Access / Air Interface | Peak/User Data Rate (order) | Key Technology Enablers | Limitations Driving Next Gen |

**Capabilities Progression:**
1. Shift from circuit-switched voice (2G) → packet-integrated (3G) → pure IP flat core (4G) → cloud-native, sliceable, service-based architecture (5G).
2. Spectral efficiency improvements via modulation + coding + MIMO + carrier aggregation.

## 11. (b) Bluetooth in Personal Area Networks (PANs) (8 Marks)
**Answer:**
Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology (typically 10 m for Class 2) designed for low-power personal area networking among devices (headsets, wearables, peripherals, IoT sensors). It complements higher-power WLAN (Wi‑Fi) and cellular by focusing on low energy consumption, simple pairing, and modest throughput.

**Main Roles in PAN Evolution:** Cable replacement (HID, audio), formation of ad hoc piconets, enabling body-area sensor networks, and supporting audio streaming (A2DP, LE Audio) and beaconing (BLE advertisements) for proximity services.

**Distinguishing Features:**
1. Frequency Band: 2.4 GHz ISM using frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS[^FHSS]); LE (BLE[^BLE]) uses adaptive channel selection among 40 channels (2 MHz spacing).
2. Topology: Piconet (1 master + up to 7 active slaves); scatternet by interconnecting piconets; BLE supports star & broadcast modes.
3. Power Classes: Multiple Tx power levels (Class 1 up to ~100 mW; Class 2 ~2.5 mW typical) enabling energy-efficient operation.
4. Low Energy (BLE): Optimized for very low duty cycle devices (years of battery life) via short connection events and advertising channels.
5. Profiles & Interoperability: Standardized profiles (HFP, A2DP[^A2DP], GATT) simplify multi-vendor ecosystem integration.
6. Security: Pairing modes (Just Works, Passkey, Numeric Comparison), AES-CCM[^AESCCM] link layer encryption.
7. Latency & Throughput: Classic BR/EDR up to ~3 Mbps raw; BLE 5 long-range (coded PHY) trades rate for robustness; direction finding (AoA/AoD[^AOA]) for positioning.
8. Coexistence: Adaptive hopping mitigates interference vs static channels used by Wi-Fi.

**Comparison vs Other Wireless:**
- Wi‑Fi: Higher throughput, higher power, infrastructure oriented; Bluetooth: lower power, simpler, PAN-focused.
- Zigbee: Mesh + ultra-low data rates; Bluetooth: broader device ecosystem and audio support.
- NFC: Very short range (cm) for secure tap; Bluetooth: meters-range sustained links.

**Short Answer:** Bluetooth enables low-power short-range device interconnection using frequency hopping and standardized profiles; BLE adds ultra-low energy modes and proximity services—differentiated from Wi‑Fi (throughput) and Zigbee (mesh, lower rate) by ecosystem breadth and audio/data versatility.

---
## 12. (a) Handoff Techniques & Seamless Mobility (8 Marks)
**Answer:**
Handoff (handover) transfers an ongoing call/data session from one cell/base station (BS) or channel to another to maintain link quality and continuity as a user moves or radio conditions change.

**Key Types:**
1. Hard Handoff (Break-Before-Make): Used in traditional GSM / early cellular. Connection to old BS is released before new one established. Simpler resource control but brief interruption; more noticeable at cell edges with rapid fading.
2. Soft Handoff (Make-Before-Break): In CDMA / some 3G systems; mobile simultaneously connected to multiple BSs (active set) combining signals (RAKE[^RAKE]). Provides macro-diversity, smoother transitions, improves Eb/N0.
3. Softer Handoff: Between sectors of the same physical BS (different sector antennas). Combines at baseband internally; reduces backhaul signaling overhead vs inter-BS soft handoff.
4. Horizontal vs Vertical Handoff: Horizontal within same RAT[^RAT] (e.g., LTE cell to LTE cell); Vertical across different RATs (e.g., LTE → Wi‑Fi) for load balancing or coverage extension.
5. Intra-frequency vs Inter-frequency (or Inter-band) Handoff: Same carrier frequency vs different carriers—latter requires retuning and measurement gaps (e.g., LTE inter-frequency measurement events). 
6. Forced / Emergency Handoff: Triggered by rapid deterioration (e.g., power below threshold, interference spike) to prevent call drop.

**Trigger Metrics:** RSSI / RSRP, quality (C/I, SINR, RSRQ), timing advance, bit/block error rates, load conditions, predicted trajectory.

**Challenges Addressed & Mitigation:**
| Challenge | Impact | Technique Response |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| Rapid signal fluctuation (fading) | Premature or late handoff → drops/ping-pong | Hysteresis margins, time-to-trigger, filtering of measurements |
| Interference / edge SINR drop | Degraded QoS | Soft/softer handoff diversity gain; interference coordination (ICIC[^ICIC], eICIC[^EICIC]) |
| High-speed mobility (Doppler) | Reduced channel coherence time | Adaptive measurement intervals, predictive mobility, fast HO signaling |
| Load imbalance | Congestion in popular cells | Load-aware / cell range expansion; vertical HO to Wi‑Fi/5G small cells |
| Heterogeneous layers (macro/pico/femto) | Coverage holes or ping-pong | Layer-specific thresholds and bias (cell selection offset) |
| Multi-RAT coexistence | Suboptimal user experience | Policy-based vertical handoff decision engines |

**Short Answer:** Hard HO breaks then makes; soft/softer HO maintain parallel links for diversity; vertical HO changes RAT; intelligent triggering (hysteresis, time-to-trigger, load-aware metrics) preserves seamless connectivity and reduces drops and ping-pong events.

## 12. (b) Optimal Cluster Size N and Reuse Factor Q (8 Marks)
**Question Restatement:** Digital TDMA system, required worst-case SIR ≥ 23 dB. Path loss exponent n = 4. Number of first-tier co-channel interferers i_0 = 6 (omnidirectional cells). Determine smallest cluster size N meeting SIR, then compute reuse factor Q.

**SIR Model (Co-Channel Interference, Equal Powers)[^SIR]:**
For large distance ratio (D/R), approximate
$$ \text{SIR} \approx \frac{(D/R)^n}{i_0} $$
with \(n=4\), \(i_0=6\).

Let required linear SIR = \(\Gamma = 10^{23/10} = 10^{2.3} \approx 199.53\) (≈ 200).

Thus:
$$ \frac{(D/R)^4}{6} \ge 199.53 \;\Rightarrow\; (D/R)^4 \ge 1197.2 $$
$$ D/R \ge (1197.2)^{1/4} $$
Fourth root: \( (1197.2)^{1/2} \approx 34.60^{1/2} \approx 5.885\) (since \(34.60\) square root of 1197.2; refine: \(\sqrt{34.60}=5.885\)).

Reuse geometry for hexagonal cells: \( D/R = \sqrt{3N} \).
So:
$$ \sqrt{3N} \ge 5.885 \;\Rightarrow\; 3N \ge 34.64 \;\Rightarrow\; N \ge 11.55 $$

Cluster size N must be an integer of the form \(N = i^2 + ij + j^2\), where \(i,j\) integers. Candidate values near ≥ 11.55: 12, 13. Valid hex cluster numbers: 1,3,4,7,9,12,13,16,... Smallest ≥ 11.55 is 12.

Therefore choose \( N = 12 \).

Compute actual SIR check:
$$ D/R = \sqrt{3\times 12} = \sqrt{36} = 6 $$
$$ \text{SIR}_{linear} = \frac{6^4}{6} = \frac{1296}{6} = 216 $$
$$ \text{SIR}_{dB} = 10\log_{10}(216) \approx 23.35\,\text{dB} \ge 23\,\text{dB (meets)} $$

Reuse Factor / Reuse Ratio:
Often expressed as \(Q = D/R = 6\) for the selected cluster size.

**Results:** Minimum feasible cluster size \(N = 12\); reuse factor (distance ratio) \(Q = 6\); achieved SIR ≈ 23.35 dB (> 23 dB requirement).

**Short Answer:** \(N=12\), \(Q=6\), SIR ≈ 23.35 dB (meets 23 dB target).

---
## 14. (a) Impulse Response Model of a Multipath Channel (7 Marks)
**Answer:** A wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS[^WSSUS]) baseband channel with L discrete resolvable paths is modeled as
$$ h(t,\tau) = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \alpha_l(t) \, \delta(\tau - \tau_l) $$
where: \(\tau_l\) = excess delay of path l, \(\alpha_l(t)= a_l e^{j\phi_l(t)}\) complex gain (amplitude fading + phase), and \(\delta(\cdot)\) Dirac delta. For time-varying Doppler shifts \(f_{D,l}\):
$$ \alpha_l(t) = a_l e^{j(2\pi f_{D,l} t + \phi_{0,l})} $$
The received baseband signal (ignoring noise) for input \(s(t)\):
$$ r(t) = \int h(t,\tau) s(t-\tau) d\tau = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \alpha_l(t) s(t-\tau_l) $$
If paths form a continuum, impulse response becomes stochastic process:
$$ h(t,\tau) = \sum_k \alpha_k(t) \delta(\tau - \tau_k) \;\Rightarrow\; R_h(t; \Delta t, \Delta \tau) = E[h(t,\tau) h^*(t+\Delta t, \tau+\Delta \tau)] $$
WSSUS assumption: uncorrelated for distinct delays →
$$ R_h(\Delta t, \tau) = P_h(\tau) R_t(\Delta t) $$
with power delay profile (PDP[^PDP]) \(P_h(\tau) = E[|h(t,\tau)|^2]\). Transfer function (time-varying frequency response):
$$ H(t,f) = \int h(t,\tau) e^{-j2\pi f\tau} d\tau = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \alpha_l(t) e^{-j2\pi f \tau_l} $$
**Short Answer:** Discrete multipath channel: \(h(t,\tau)=\sum_l \alpha_l(t)\delta(\tau-\tau_l)\); output is sum of time-varying scaled, delayed replicas of input.

---
## 14. (b) Flat vs Frequency-Selective Fading (4 Marks)
**Answer:**
| Aspect | Flat Fading | Frequency-Selective Fading |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Relation of signal BW (B_s) to coherence bandwidth (B_c) | \(B_s \ll B_c\) | \(B_s > B_c\) |
| Channel effect | Single complex gain multiplies entire signal | Different subbands experience different gains (amplitude/phase distortion) |
| ISI Presence | Negligible (symbol duration >> delay spread) | Significant ISI (delay spread comparable to / larger than symbol time) |
| Equalization Need | Simple (one-tap) or none | Requires multi-tap equalizer or multicarrier (OFDM) |
| Diversity Opportunity | Limited frequency diversity | Exploitable frequency diversity across subcarriers |
| BER Variation | All frequencies fade together | Some frequencies deep fade, others strong |
| Mitigation | Power control, time/frequency interleaving | OFDM + coding + adaptive bit loading, RAKE/DFE |
**Short Answer:** Flat fading = bandwidth narrower than channel coherence → uniform gain, no ISI; frequency-selective = signal spans multiple fading taps → distortion + ISI, requiring equalization/multicarrier.

---
## 14. (c) Coherence Time Calculation (3 Marks)
**Answer:** Given velocity v = 50 m/s, carrier f_c = 1800 MHz. Wavelength: \(\lambda = c/f_c = 3\times10^8 / 1.8\times10^9 = 0.1667\,\text{m}\). Maximum Doppler shift: \(f_D = v/\lambda = 50 / 0.1667 \approx 300\,\text{Hz}\). Approximate coherence time (common empirical): \(T_c \approx \frac{1}{2 f_D} = \frac{1}{600} \approx 1.67\,\text{ms}\). (Alternate Jakes form \(0.423/f_D \approx 1.41\,\text{ms}\); either acceptable if stated.)
**Short Answer:** \(f_D \approx 300\,\text{Hz}\); \(T_c \approx 1.4\text{–}1.7\,\text{ms}\) depending on formula used.

---
## 15. (a) Average BER of BPSK in Rayleigh Flat Fading (8 Marks)
**Answer:** Conditional BER of coherent BPSK over AWGN[^AWGN] at instantaneous SNR \(\gamma\): \(P_b(\gamma) = Q[^QFUNC](\sqrt{2\gamma})\). For Rayleigh flat fading (slow or symbol-rate variation) with average SNR \(\bar{\gamma}\), the PDF: \(f_\gamma(\gamma) = \frac{1}{\bar{\gamma}} e^{-\gamma/\bar{\gamma}}\). Average BER:
$$ \bar{P_b} = \int_0^{\infty} Q(\sqrt{2\gamma}) \frac{1}{\bar{\gamma}} e^{-\gamma/\bar{\gamma}} d\gamma $$
Closed form identity: \( \int_0^{\infty} Q(\sqrt{a x}) e^{-b x} dx = \frac{1}{2b} \left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{b}{b+a/2}}\right) \) with \(a=2, b=1/\bar{\gamma}\). Thus:
$$ \bar{P_b} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{\bar{\gamma}}{1+\bar{\gamma}}}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{\text{SNR}_{avg}}{1+\text{SNR}_{avg}}}\right) $$
Applies when symbol duration ≥ channel coherence time (independent fading per symbol) or slow enough that each symbol sees quasi-static gain but interleaving spans many fades.
**Short Answer:** \(\bar{P_b} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(1 - \sqrt{\bar{\gamma}/(1+\bar{\gamma})}\right)\).

---
## 15. (b) Required Average SNR for BER < 10^{-4} with 95% Reliability (— Marks)
**Answer:** Target: BER threshold \(P_b^{th} = 10^{-4}\). From 15(a): \(\bar{P_b}(\bar{\gamma}) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \sqrt{\frac{\bar{\gamma}}{1+\bar{\gamma}}}\right)\). Solve for \(\bar{\gamma}\) meeting \(\bar{P_b} = 10^{-4}\):
Set \(1 - \sqrt{\frac{\bar{\gamma}}{1+\bar{\gamma}}} = 2\times10^{-4} \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{\bar{\gamma}}{1+\bar{\gamma}}} = 1 - 2\times10^{-4} = 0.9998\).
Square: \(\frac{\bar{\gamma}}{1+\bar{\gamma}} = 0.9996 \Rightarrow \bar{\gamma} = 0.9996(1+\bar{\gamma}) \Rightarrow \bar{\gamma} - 0.9996 \bar{\gamma} = 0.9996 \Rightarrow 0.0004 \bar{\gamma} = 0.9996 \Rightarrow \bar{\gamma} = 2499 \approx 2.5\times10^{3}\).
In dB: \(10 \log_{10}(2499) \approx 34.0\,\text{dB}\).

However requirement adds 95% reliability: Probability that average BER < 10^{-4} should be ≥0.95. In quasi-static (slow) fading, instantaneous SNR \(\gamma\) is exponential with mean \(\bar{\gamma}\). Condition \(P_b(\gamma) = Q(\sqrt{2\gamma}) < 10^{-4}\) roughly needs instantaneous \(\gamma \gtrsim 8.4\) dB (since AWGN BPSK BER 10^{-4} ≈ Q(√(2γ)) ⇒ √(2γ) ≈ Q^{-1}(10^{-4}) ≈ 3.719 ⇒ γ ≈ (3.719^2)/2 ≈ 6.92 ≈ 8.4 dB when accounting for approximation). Using threshold \(\gamma_{th} \approx 7\) dB (≈5 in linear) to 8 dB for margin.

Reliability constraint: \(P\{\gamma > \gamma_{th}\} = e^{-\gamma_{th}/\bar{\gamma}} \ge 0.95 \Rightarrow e^{-\gamma_{th}/\bar{\gamma}} \ge 0.95 \Rightarrow \bar{\gamma} \ge \gamma_{th} / (-\ln 0.95) \).
Take \(\gamma_{th} = 6.9\) (linear) (≈ 8.4 dB):
\(-\ln 0.95 = 0.051293\) ⇒ \(\bar{\gamma} \ge 6.9 / 0.051293 ≈ 134.6\) (≈ 21.3 dB).

Conservative design uses higher of two computations: 34 dB (from average BER formula) vs 21 dB (from reliability of instantaneous threshold). Because average BER formula already integrates fading, the 34 dB solution ensures \(\bar{P_b}\le 10^{-4}\) unconditionally; 95% reliability of instantaneous criterion alone underestimates requirement.

**Result:** Required average SNR ≈ 34 dB (linear ≈ 2.5×10^3) to achieve average BER < 10^{-4}. Reliability note: If instead interpreting “95% of time BER < 10^{-4}” under instantaneous AWGN mapping, ~21 dB would suffice, but strict average target dictates ~34 dB.
**Short Answer:** \(\bar{\gamma} \approx 2.5\times10^{3}\) (≈34 dB) for \(\bar{P_b}<10^{-4}\); 95% instantaneous criterion alone would give ≈21 dB.

## 16. (a) Implementation of an OFDM System (8 Marks)
**Answer:** Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmits data in parallel over N mutually orthogonal narrowband subcarriers, converting a frequency-selective wideband channel into N approximately flat subchannels enabling simple one-tap equalization per subcarrier.

**Key Transmitter Steps:**
1. Bit Source & Channel Coding (FEC[^FEC]): Input bits → encoder (e.g., convolutional / LDPC / Polar) + interleaver.
2. Modulation Mapping: Groups of k bits → complex QAM symbols \(X_k\) for subcarriers k = 0…N−1.
3. (Optional) Pilot & Null Insertion: Allocate pilot subcarriers for channel estimation; DC null and guard subcarriers at spectrum edges.
4. IFFT (Size N): Time-domain OFDM symbol \( x[n] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k e^{j2\pi kn/N} \), n=0…N−1.
5. Cyclic Prefix (CP) Addition: Prepend last L_CP samples of x[n] to front → length N+L_CP. CP length ≥ channel max delay spread ensures circular convolution: \( y[n] = h * x[n] \Rightarrow Y_k = H_k X_k + W_k \).
6. DAC, RF Upconversion, Power Amplifier → Antenna.

**Receiver Steps (Inverse):** RF downconvert → ADC → CP Removal → N-point FFT to recover \(Y_k\). Estimate channel using pilots (\(\hat{H}_k\)); Equalize one-tap (ZF: \(\hat{X}_k = Y_k/\hat{H}_k\); MMSE variant) → Demapper (LLRs) → De-interleaver → FEC Decoder → Bit Sink.

**Orthogonality & Subcarrier Spacing:** \( \Delta f = 1/T_u \) (useful symbol duration). Orthogonality: \( \int_0^{T_u} e^{j2\pi (k-m) t / T_u} dt = 0, k \ne m \). Guard interval (CP) prevents ISI & ICI if channel delay spread < CP.

**Time/Freq Representation:**
Time-domain sample complexity O(N log N) via FFT vs serial single-carrier equalizer requiring long adaptive filters in frequency-selective channels.

**Mermaid Block Diagram (Transmitter & Receiver):**

```

**Mathematical Model:** After CP removal: \( r[n] = \sum_{l=0}^{L_h-1} h_l x[(n - l) \text{ mod } N] + w[n] \). FFT: \( Y_k = H_k X_k + W_k \). Simplifies equalization relative to time-domain multi-tap inversion.

**Advantages:** Robust to frequency-selective fading; flexible allocation; simple per-subcarrier equalization; supports adaptive modulation & coding (AMC[^AMC]); facilitates MIMO (per-subcarrier spatial processing).

**Limitations:** High PAPR (needs back-off in PA); sensitivity to frequency offset & phase noise; CP overhead reduces spectral efficiency; out-of-band leakage (needs windowing/filtering for spectral masks); potential EVM[^EVM] degradation under PA nonlinearity.

**Short Answer:** OFDM maps coded bits to QAM symbols, inserts pilots, applies IFFT, adds CP for circular convolution, then transmits; receiver removes CP, FFTs, estimates channel, one-tap equalizes, demaps, and decodes.

---
## 16. (b) Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) in OFDM & Reduction (7 Marks)
**Answer:** PAPR quantifies dynamic range of OFDM waveform:
$$ \text{PAPR} = \frac{\max_{0 \le t < T}|x(t)|^2}{E[|x(t)|^2]} $$
Discrete (oversampled) variant: \( \text{PAPR} = \max_n |x[n]|^2 / (\frac{1}{N}\sum_n |x[n]|^2) \). High PAPR arises from coherent addition of many independently modulated subcarriers (central limit → near-complex Gaussian samples; amplitude ≈ Rayleigh). Leads to PA inefficiency & nonlinear distortion (spectral regrowth, EVM, BER degradation).

**Statistical Characterization (CCDF):** Probability PAPR exceeds threshold z: \( \text{CCDF}(z) = P\{\text{PAPR} > z\} \). For ideal i.i.d. subcarriers (Nyquist sampling) approximate: \( \text{CCDF}(z) \approx 1 - (1 - e^{-z})^M \) with M ≈ number of (independent) time-domain samples (often > N due to oversampling factor). Tail behavior drives amplifier back-off design.

**PAPR Reduction Techniques:**
1. Clipping & Filtering: Limit amplitude peaks; simple; causes in-band distortion (BER) + out-of-band radiation (needs iterative filtering).
2. Companding (µ-law, exponential): Nonlinear compression then expansion; lowers peaks, raises average power (noise enhancement risk).
3. Selective Mapping (SLM): Multiply symbol vector by U different phase sequences; choose candidate with lowest PAPR. Need to send side information (log2 U bits). Complexity scales with U.
4. Partial Transmit Sequences (PTS): Partition subcarriers into disjoint subblocks; optimize phase factors to minimize peak; requires side info; combinatorial search (heuristics used).
5. Tone Reservation (TR): Reserve a small set of subcarriers; optimize their symbols (often via convex methods) to cancel peaks; no distortion; spectral efficiency loss.
6. Tone Injection (TI): Map constellation points to alternative lattice points to reduce peaks; increases average transmit power & complexity.
7. Active Constellation Extension (ACE): Expand outer constellation points within decision regions to lower PAPR; minimal side info; modest complexity.
8. DFT-Spread OFDM (SC-FDMA in LTE uplink): Applies DFT precoding before subcarrier mapping → single-carrier like envelope (lower PAPR) at cost of reduced scheduling flexibility across frequency.
9. Coding Techniques: Use specially designed block codes guaranteeing upper PAPR bounds; rate loss & design complexity.
10. Windowing/Filtering & Pulse Shaping: Smooth transitions to slightly mitigate peaks (limited standalone effect).

**Technique Trade-offs Summary:**
| Method | Distortion? | Side Info | Complexity | Spectral Efficiency Impact | Typical PAPR dB Gain |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|----------------------------|----------------------|
| Clipping + Filtering | Yes (in-band) | No | Low | None (possible regrowth mask penalty) | 3–5 dB |
| Companding | Yes | No | Low-Med | None | 3–6 dB |
| SLM | No (chosen signal) | Yes | U IFFTs | Slight (side info) | 2–6 dB (depends U) |
| PTS | No (chosen signal) | Yes | High (phase search) | Slight | 3–7 dB |
| Tone Reservation | No | No | Optimization per symbol | Reserves tones | 3–6 dB |
| Tone Injection | No (power ↑) | No | Mapping search | Power ↑ (amp back-off) | 3–6 dB |
| ACE | Minimal | No | Iterative | Negligible | 3–5 dB |
| DFT-Spread OFDM | Structural | No | One DFT/IDFT | Changes resource mapping | 2–4 dB |

**Design Considerations:** Combine moderate clipping with digital pre-distortion (DPD[^DPD]) for PA efficiency; in uplink choose SC-FDMA to reduce UE PAPR; downlink may use SLM/PTS selectively for high-order modulation carriers.

**Short Answer:** PAPR = peak instantaneous power / average power of OFDM symbol; high due to many summed subcarriers. Reduce via clipping/filtering, SLM, PTS, tone reservation/injection, ACE, companding, or DFT-spreading (SC-FDMA) depending on distortion, complexity, and side info trade-offs.

## 17. (a) Alamouti Scheme for 2×2 MIMO (7 Marks)
**Answer:** The classic Alamouti Space-Time Block Code (STBC[^STBC]) provides full diversity gain with simple linear combiner. For 2 Tx, 1 or more Rx antennas, code rate = 1.

**Transmit Encoding (2 Time Slots):** For complex symbols \(s_1, s_2\):
Time slot t: Antenna 1 → \(s_1\), Antenna 2 → \(s_2\)
Time slot t+T: Antenna 1 → \(-s_2^*\), Antenna 2 → \( s_1^*\)

Code matrix (rows=time, columns=Tx):
\[\mathbf{S} = \begin{bmatrix} s_1 & s_2 \\ -s_2^* & s_1^* \end{bmatrix}\]
Orthogonality: \( \mathbf{S}^H \mathbf{S} = (|s_1|^2 + |s_2|^2) \mathbf{I}_2 \).

**Channel Model (2×2):** Let first receive antenna channels: \(h_{1}, h_{2}\) from Tx1, Tx2; second receive antenna: \(g_{1}, g_{2}\). Assume quasi-static flat fading over two time slots.

Received signals (Rx antenna 1):
\( y_{1} = h_1 s_1 + h_2 s_2 + n_{1} \)
\( y_{2} = -h_1 s_2^* + h_2 s_1^* + n_{2} \)
Similarly for second Rx: \( z_{1} = g_1 s_1 + g_2 s_2 + n'_{1} \), \( z_{2} = -g_1 s_2^* + g_2 s_1^* + n'_{2} \).

Form decision statistics (combine conjugate of second slot):
\[ \tilde{s}_1 = h_1^* y_1 + h_2 y_2^* + g_1^* z_1 + g_2 z_2^* = (|h_1|^2 + |h_2|^2 + |g_1|^2 + |g_2|^2) s_1 + \tilde{n}_1 \]
\[ \tilde{s}_2 = h_2^* y_1 - h_1 y_2^* + g_2^* z_1 - g_1 z_2^* = (|h_1|^2 + |h_2|^2 + |g_1|^2 + |g_2|^2) s_2 + \tilde{n}_2 \]

Thus each symbol sees sum of squared magnitudes (diversity order up to 4 with 2 Rx). Simple linear combining (no ML search) yields optimal detection for this orthogonal design.

**Properties:**
| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Code rate | 1 (two symbols over two slots) |
| Diversity order (with R Rx) | 2R |
| Decoding | Linear combining + scalar decisions |
| Complexity | Low |
| Assumptions | Channel constant over code block (2 slots) |
| Limitations | Extends to >2 Tx only with rate<1 orthogonal codes (e.g., rate 3/4 for 3 or 4 Tx) |

**Short Answer:** Alamouti maps \([s_1,s_2]\) over two antennas & two times as \(\begin{bmatrix}s_1 & s_2\\ -s_2^* & s_1^*\end{bmatrix}\); linear combining gives full transmit diversity with rate 1 and simple decoding.

## 17. (b) Multiple Access Methods Comparison (8 Marks)
**Answer:** Multiple access partitions shared medium in frequency, time, code, or subcarrier resources.

| Attribute | FDMA | TDMA | CDMA | OFDMA |
|-----------|------|------|------|-------|
| Resource Dimension | Separate frequency bands | Time slots in a frame | Spread-spectrum codes over full band | Orthogonal subcarriers (frequency bins + time symbols) |
| User Separation | Guard bands | Guard times / sync | Low cross-correlation codes (orthogonal/pseudo-random) | Subcarrier allocation (dynamic) |
| Spectral Efficiency | Moderate (guard bands waste) | Higher than FDMA; frame overhead | High (frequency reuse factor 1) but interference-limited | High; flexible allocation & adaptive modulation |
| Power Control Importance | Moderate | Moderate (for uplink fairness) | Critical (near-far problem) | Important (but less severe than CDMA; per subcarrier adaptation) |
| Complexity | Low | Moderate (synchronization) | High (RAKE, multiuser detection) | High (FFT, scheduling, CQI feedback) |
| Resilience to Fading | Frequency-selective per user channel | Slot-level variations; frequency diversity limited | Frequency diversity inherent (spreading) + multipath combining | Fine-grained frequency diversity via scheduling & coding |
| Interference Nature | Adjacent channel & IMD | Co-channel timeslot collisions if unsync | Multiple access interference (MAI) + self-jam | Inter-carrier interference if sync errors |
| QoS Flexibility | Limited | Moderate via slot allocation | Harder (code & power adjustments) | High (dynamic subcarrier/time allocation) |
| Typical Use | 1G analog / some satellite | 2G GSM | 3G (W-CDMA, cdma2000) | 4G/5G downlink & uplink (OFDMA / SC-FDMA) |
| Guard Overheads | Guard bands | Guard periods | Code orthogonality degradation with load | CP + pilot overhead |

**Short Answer:** FDMA splits spectrum; TDMA splits time; CDMA overlays users via codes needing power control; OFDMA assigns orthogonal subcarriers/time slots enabling adaptive, high spectral efficiency.

## 18. (a) Role of LMS Algorithm in Adaptive Equalization (7 Marks)
**Answer:** The Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm adapts filter tap weights to minimize the mean square error (MSE[^MSE]) between equalizer output and a desired reference (training symbols or decision-directed estimates), counteracting time-varying ISI in dispersive channels with low computational complexity.

**Equalizer Structure:** FIR with weight vector \(\mathbf{w}[n]\); input vector \(\mathbf{x}[n] = [x[n], x[n-1], ..., x[n-L+1]]^T\). Output: \( y[n] = \mathbf{w}^H[n] \mathbf{x}[n] \). Error: \( e[n] = d[n] - y[n] \), where \(d[n]\) is known training symbol (or tentative decision for decision-directed mode).

**LMS Weight Update:**
$$ \mathbf{w}[n+1] = \mathbf{w}[n] + \mu \, e^*[n] \, \mathbf{x}[n] $$
Step size \(\mu\) controls convergence vs stability. Approximate stability bound: \( 0 < \mu < 2/\lambda_{max} \) (largest eigenvalue of input autocorrelation matrix \(\mathbf{R}\)). Practical heuristic: \( \mu \lesssim 1/(5 L P_x) \) where \(P_x\) is input power.

**Operation Phases:**
1. Training (known sequence) for fast initial convergence.
2. Decision-Directed tracking (replace \(d[n]\) with sliced \(\hat{s}[n]\)) to follow slow channel variations.

**Why LMS:** Low complexity O(L) per symbol vs RLS (O(L^2)); robust, easily implemented in hardware/DSP. Converges to vicinity of Wiener solution with excess MSE (misadjustment) \(M \approx \frac{\mu}{2} \text{Tr}(\mathbf{R})\).

**Variants:** Normalized LMS (NLMS) uses adaptive step: \( \mathbf{w}[n+1] = \mathbf{w}[n] + \frac{\mu}{\epsilon + \|\mathbf{x}[n]\|^2} e^*[n] \mathbf{x}[n] \); improves convergence under power fluctuations. Other: RLS (faster, higher complexity), CMA (blind), DD-LMS (tracking), VSLMS (variable step size).

**Short Answer:** LMS iteratively updates equalizer taps via \(\mathbf{w}_{n+1}=\mathbf{w}_n+\mu e^*_n \mathbf{x}_n\) to minimize ISI-induced MSE with low complexity and adaptive tracking.

---
## 18. (b) Uplink vs Downlink in Multiuser Systems (8 Marks)
**Answer:** Uplink (UL, user→base station) and downlink (DL, base station→users) differ in power asymmetry, channel estimation direction, interference structure, and scheduling constraints.

| Aspect | Uplink (UL) | Downlink (DL) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Transmit Power Budget | Low & constrained (battery devices) | Higher (BS mains powered) |
| Peak-to-Average Constraints | Critical (PAPR mitigations e.g., SC-FDMA) | Less restrictive (OFDMA widely used) |
| Multiple Access Mechanism | SC-FDMA (LTE), UL OFDMA (5G), random access preambles | OFDMA / resource blocks scheduled |
| Channel Estimation | BS estimates per-user UL channel from pilots | UEs estimate DL channel from reference signals; BS relies on feedback (CQI[^CQI], PMI[^PMI], RI[^RI]) |
| Reciprocity Use | In TDD, UL estimates reused for DL precoding (after calibration) | FDD lacks reciprocity (needs feedback) |
| Interference Profile | Interference from other UEs (power-controlled) | Inter-cell interference dominant; intra-cell managed by precoding |
| Scheduling Objective | Fairness vs battery vs latency; limited feedback overhead | Throughput maximization + QoS classes; rich CSI allows beamforming |
| Power Control | Fast closed-loop to mitigate near-far | DL power shaping across beams/subcarriers |
| MIMO Processing | Uplink combining (receive beamforming) at BS | Downlink precoding / beamforming at BS |
| Mobility Impact | Timing advance needed; random access collisions | Doppler affects CSI aging & beam tracking |
| HARQ Timing | UL grants & ACK/NACK windows; device timing constraints | DL scheduling + UE ACK/NACK feedback (HARQ[^HARQ]) |
| Resource Constraints | UE RF chains limited (fewer antennas) | BS massive MIMO arrays feasible |

**Challenges:**
- UL: Near-far effect, tight power control loops, random access collisions, limited UE antenna count, energy efficiency.
- DL: Accurate CSI acquisition under mobility, inter-cell interference (especially at edges), scheduling fairness, massive MIMO beam management.

**Short Answer:** Uplink is power/feedback constrained with BS-side combining and strong power control; downlink leverages higher BS power & precoding but depends on timely CSI feedback or reciprocity.

## 19. (a) Derivation of Ionospheric Refractive Index Expression (9 Marks)
**Answer:** The ionosphere is a weakly ionized plasma. For an EM wave of angular frequency \(\omega\) propagating in a cold, collisionless, unmagnetized plasma (ignoring Earth's magnetic field initially), electron motion satisfies:
$$ m_e \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = -e E_0 e^{-j\omega t} $$
Solution: \( x = \frac{e}{m_e \omega^2} E_0 e^{-j\omega t} \). Induced current density: \( J = -n_e e \frac{dx}{dt} = j \frac{n_e e^2}{m_e \omega} E_0 e^{-j\omega t} \). Polarization \( P = \epsilon_0 \chi_e E \) gives effective permittivity:
$$ \epsilon = \epsilon_0 \left(1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2} \right), \qquad \omega_p^2 = \frac{n_e e^2}{\epsilon_0 m_e} $$
Refractive index squared: \( n^2 = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0} = 1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2} = 1 - \frac{f_p^2}{f^2} \) where plasma frequency \( f_p = \omega_p / (2\pi) \).

Including collisions (electron-neutral) with collision frequency \( \nu \):
$$ n^2 = 1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega (\omega + j\nu)} $$
Under Earth's magnetic field (Appleton-Hartree):
$$ n^2 = 1 - \frac{X}{1 - jZ \mp \frac{Y_T^2}{2(1 - X - jZ)} + \sqrt{\left(\frac{Y_T^2}{2(1 - X - jZ)}\right)^2 + Y_L^2}} $$
Simplified ordinary-wave (ignoring magnetic splitting & collisions for most HF critical frequency calculations):
$$ n \approx \sqrt{1 - \frac{f_p^2}{f^2}} $$
Wave reflects (refracted back) when the term under square root becomes zero ⇒ cutoff/critical frequency \( f_c = f_p \).

**Short Answer:** Neglecting collisions & magnetic field: \( n = \sqrt{1 - f_p^2/f^2} \) with \( f_p = 9\sqrt{N_e} \) kHz (\(N_e\) in electrons/cm³).

---
## 19. (b) Maximum Ionic Density & Critical Frequency (6 Marks)
**Answer:** Given refractive index \( n = 0.92 \) at frequency \( f = 10\,\text{MHz} \). Using \( n^2 = 1 - f_p^2/f^2 \):
$$ f_p = f \sqrt{1 - n^2} = 10\,\text{MHz} \times \sqrt{1 - 0.92^2} $$
Compute: \( 0.92^2 = 0.8464 \Rightarrow 1 - 0.8464 = 0.1536 \). \( \sqrt{0.1536} = 0.3920 \).
Thus \( f_p = 10 \times 0.3920 = 3.92\,\text{MHz} \).

Plasma frequency relation (with electron density in m^{-3}):
$$ f_p(\text{Hz}) = 8.98 \times 10^3 \sqrt{N_e(\text{cm}^{-3})} = 8.98 \sqrt{N_e(\text{m}^{-3})/10^{12}}\,\text{MHz} $$
Solve for maximum electron (ionic) density \(N_{max}\):
\( N_{max} = \left( \frac{f_p}{8.98\,\text{kHz}} \right)^2 \text{ cm}^{-3} = \left( \frac{3.92\times10^6}{8.98\times10^3} \right)^2 \approx (436.4)^2 \approx 1.90\times10^{5}\,\text{cm}^{-3} \).
Convert to m^{-3}: \( 1.90\times10^{5} \times 10^{6} = 1.90\times10^{11}\,\text{m}^{-3} \).

Critical frequency for vertical incidence corresponds to \( f_c = f_p = 3.92\,\text{MHz} \) (this is the layer's critical frequency; the probing 10 MHz wave has refractive index <1 and would pass if not at lower angle). Given the wave at 10 MHz sees n=0.92, the layer would reflect frequencies below 3.92 MHz at vertical incidence.

**Results:** \( f_p = f_c \approx 3.92\,\text{MHz} \); \( N_{max} \approx 1.9 \times 10^{11}\,\text{m}^{-3} \).

**Short Answer:** \( f_c = 3.92\,\text{MHz} \); maximum electron density \( \approx 1.9\times10^{11}\,\text{m}^{-3} \) (\(1.9\times10^{5}\,\text{cm}^{-3}\)).

---
## 20. (a) Influence of Earth’s Magnetic Field on Ionospheric Propagation (7 Marks)
**Answer:** The geomagnetic field causes the ionospheric plasma to become anisotropic, splitting an incident wave into ordinary (O) and extraordinary (X) magneto-ionic modes with distinct refractive indices given approximately by the Appleton-Hartree equation. Consequences:

1. Birefringence (Mode Splitting): Different phase velocities for O & X modes → differential phase shift.
2. Faraday Rotation: Linear polarization rotates as it propagates; rotation angle \( \theta_F = 2.36 \times 10^4 \int N_e B_{||} / f^2 \, dl \) (radians, f in Hz) causing polarization mismatch losses if uncorrected.
3. Differential Absorption: Collision and gyro-frequency terms produce slightly different attenuation in D/E layers for each mode.
4. Critical Frequency Modification: Effective cutoff differs slightly for O and X modes (X-mode supports slightly higher penetration frequency), impacting HF frequency planning.
5. Dispersion & Group Delay: Different group refractive indices → timing dispersion relevant to wideband pulses.
6. Circular Polarization Preference: At certain frequencies near gyro-frequency harmonics, one circular component may be preferentially absorbed/reflected.

**Mitigation / Use:** Use circularly polarized antennas to average rotation, implement frequency diversity, apply real-time ionospheric sounding for frequency management, exploit Faraday rotation for remote sensing of electron content (TEC estimation).

**Short Answer:** Magnetic field creates anisotropic magneto-ionic medium → O/X mode splitting, Faraday rotation, altered critical frequencies, and differential absorption/dispersion.

---
## 20. (b) Required Receiving Antenna Height (6 Marks)
**Answer:** Given distance between antennas \( d = 65\,\text{km} \), transmit antenna height \( h_t = 100\,\text{m} \). Using effective Earth radius factor \(k = 4/3\), radio horizon for each antenna (approx, with heights in meters, distance in km):
$$ d \approx 3.57 (\sqrt{h_t} + \sqrt{h_r}) $$
Solve for \( h_r \):
\( 65 = 3.57 (\sqrt{100} + \sqrt{h_r}) = 3.57 (10 + \sqrt{h_r}) \Rightarrow 65/3.57 = 10 + \sqrt{h_r} \).
Compute: \(65/3.57 \approx 18.207 \Rightarrow \sqrt{h_r} \approx 8.207 \Rightarrow h_r \approx 67.4\,\text{m}.\)

Check without k-factor (geometric Earth): constant ≈ 3.57 already incorporates k=4/3. If severe refraction differs, result would adjust slightly.

**Result:** Required receiving antenna height ≈ 67 m for LOS path over 65 km with 100 m transmit antenna under standard atmosphere (k=4/3).

**Short Answer:** \( h_r \approx 67\,\text{m} \) to achieve a 65 km radio horizon with \( h_t = 100\,\text{m} \).
