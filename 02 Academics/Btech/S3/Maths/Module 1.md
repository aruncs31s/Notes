### Sample Problems 

1. Solve (3 Marks)
$$
\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial_{x}\partial_{y}} = x^2 y
$$
2. Derive a **partial differential equation** from the relation (3 Marks)
$$
z = f(x + at) + g(x - at)
$$
3. Solve  (7 Marks)
$$
x(y-z)p + y(z -x )q = z(x-y)
$$

4. Use Charpit's method to solve 
$$
q+xp = p^2
$$
5. Find the differential equation of all spheres of fixed radius having their centers in the $xy$ -plane.
6. Using the method of separation of variables , solve 
$$
\partial \frac{u}{\partial x} = 2 \frac{{\partial u}}{\partial t} + u 
$$
*where $u(x,0) = 6e^{-3x}$*
