# Module 1
The materials to be presented in this and the next chapter have been found
 over the years to be useful and necessary for gaining a deep understanding of a
 large variety of semiconductor devices. Mastery of the terms, concepts, and models
 presented here will prepare you for understanding not only the many
 semiconductor devices that are in existence today but also many more that will be
 invented in the future. It will also enable you to communicate knowledgeably with
 others working in the field of semiconductor devices.
