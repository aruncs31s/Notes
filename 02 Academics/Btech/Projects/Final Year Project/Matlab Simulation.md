### ECC 
Communication Simulation with Error Correcting Code using Matlab

The objective of this study is to evaluate the **performance of different type of error correcting code** in an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Error control coding incorporates information into the signal that allows a receiver to find and correct bit error occurring in transmission and storage. Since such coding detects or correct errors incurred in the communication or storage channel, it is often referred to as **channel coding**.
