# Project 
Our project is to implemnt a communication system using Software Defined Radio(SDR) in 5Ghz using the Adalm Pluto SDR  in **GNU Radio**

## Requirement
1. One laptop should transmit a file and another laptop should be able to receive the transmitted file over the air (already done)
2. After designing the communication system , We should be able to measure it's perfomance using common perfomance analysis techniques like Calculating **BER** and Plotting **SNR Waterfall curve** 
3.
