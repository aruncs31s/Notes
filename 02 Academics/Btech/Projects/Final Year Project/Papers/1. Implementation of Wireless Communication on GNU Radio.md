# Implementation of Wireless Communication on GNU Radio

Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP)
H264 (MPEG_4) encoding

- The encoder was implemented in C++ to get compressed data

**GMSK System Model**
GMSK can be viewed as either frequency or phase modulation.
- The rate of change of Phase is controlled by **Gaussian Filter**

Performance of a wireless system is dependent on the efficiency of the
modulation scheme in use.

### Gnu Radio
- GNU Radio take this advantages of C++ to realize highly optimized signal processing code as a well as the user friendly language Python to construct applications
- The users can design their own blocks using C++ and install those blocks to the library after generating the Python code by SWIG

### USRP
USRP is basically a motherboard with FPGA as well as USB microcontroller. It has a daughterboard which has both transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX)

- Main Usage: Primary Routing
- Can be used for signal processing

various daughterboards
Basic RX: Receiver for use with external RF hardware
- Basic TX: Transmitter for use with external RF hardware
- LFRX: DC to 30 MHz receiver
- LFTX: DC to 30 MHz transmitter
- TVRX: 50 to 860 MHz receiver
- DBSRX: 800 MHz to 2.4 GHz
- WBX: 50 MHz to 2.2 GHz transceiver
- RFX400: 400-500 MHz transceiver
- RFX900 : 750-1050 MHz transceiver
- RFX1200: 1150-1450 MHz transceiver
- RFX2400: 2.3-2.9 GHz transceiver
- XCVR2450: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz dual band transceiver

#### Boost In Gnu Radio
- [ ] Need to checkout

#### FM Radio 
GRC comes with all predefined blocks for signal sources, sinks and modulations

```bash
  ./usrp_oscope.py –f 2.45 G
  ./usrp_oscope.py -2.45 G –d 256 –R B
  ./usrp_fft - 2.45 G – 16 –R
  ./usrp_fm_tx_gui.py –f 2.45 G –T
  ./usrp_fm_rx_gui.py –f 2.45G –R B 

```

```bash
./usrp_oscope.py –f 2.45 G

```

*It generates a $sin$ signal *

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Generated sin] --> B[Daughterboard] --> C[Mother Board]

```

```bash
./usrp_oscope.py -2.45 G –d 256 –R B

```

*Observes the signal in time domain with decimation rate $256$ from daughterboard on slot B*  

```bash
./usrp_fft - 2.45 G – 16 –R

```

*To observe the signal frequency in frequency domain* 
*Spectrum analyzer was used to observe the signal at center frequency of 2.45 GHz with 4 MHz bandwidth from the daughterboard on slot B of the USRP motherboard*[^1]

```bash
./usrp_fm_rx_gui.py –f 2.45G –R B 

```

*used to show the maximum frequency transmitted which matched with frequency on daughterboard*

#### Questions
1. How to increase performance of data transmission
> In this paper they implemented **packet error experment**

#### Implementation
- We first read data file from the hard disk
- then sent it to the encoder implemented in C++
- After encoding, the transmitter reads the data file and starts modulation
- After modulation, the transmitter puts the packets into USRP  and sends it to the receiver
- [ ] Convert it to mermaid

- [ ] Need to checkout `benchmark_rx.py` 
#####  Commands to Activate Receiver and Transmitter
The `benchmark_tx` transmits the data through USRP on the communication channel.
- it always listen for data through **USRP**

```bash
# Rx Side
./benchmark_rx.py –f 2.45G –w 0 –u 1-m GMSK - tiff_1 -r
500k

```

```bash 
# Tx side 
./benchmark_tx.py –f 2.45G –w 0 –u 1-m bpsk – from file
tennis_2. tiff_1 -r 500k

```

*Sometimes, the reception of data packets was delayed and this is called propagation delay.*

`benchmark_rx.py` is modified to include protection against packet loss
and packet corruption along with duplicate packets

#### Findings 
- The results are achieved by changing the modulation scheme while keeping bit rate constant. 
- GMSK has high spectral efficiency
- But it needs a higher power level than BPSK, in order to transmit the same amount of data reliably.
- This is why GMSK is performing poorly compared to BPSK.?
