# Correlation Estimator
The Correlation Estimator block correlates the input signal against the provided vector of samples. This block is **designed to search for a sync word** by correlation and uses the results of the correlation to get a time and phase offset estimate. These estimates are passed downstream as stream tags for use by follow-on synchronization blocks.
