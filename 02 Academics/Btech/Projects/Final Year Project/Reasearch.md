- `rational_resampler_xxx_0` uses integer decimation but doesn't specify taps, which could lead to aliasing

```python
firdes.root_raised_cosine(
    nfilts,               # 1. Filter gain
    nfilts,               # 2. Sampling rate
    1.0/float(sps),       # 3. Symbol rate
    0.35,                 # 4. Excess bandwidth (roll-off factor)
    11*sps*nfilts         # 5. Number of taps
)

```
