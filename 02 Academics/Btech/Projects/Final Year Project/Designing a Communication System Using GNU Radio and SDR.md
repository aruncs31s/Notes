We are designing a communication system using GNU Radio , our initial plan is to design and analyze a communication system . 
**What have been done till Now **
1. Designed a simple communication system (BPSK) and (QPSK)
2. Transmitted and successfully recovered a text file 

**What we now wanned to do.**
1. Calculate ber of the communication system (BPSK) 

## **Tasks**

2. [ ] Choosing a good Modulation scheme
3. [ ] Designing Transmitter and Receiver in GNU Radio
4. [ ] Measuring SNR and BER to evaluate the performance
5. [ ] Optimization
