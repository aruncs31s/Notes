## Module 1
- What are the different components of **Embedded Hardware**
>1. MCU/MPU: Micro Controller Units and Micro-Processor units are used in **Embedded Systems** to increase it functionality, integrate more functions etc. The controllers used are usually much more power efficient than the regular general purpose computer and such. 
>2. Memmory: Memory , there are 2 types of memory are used in Embededd Systems( or MCU) Main memory , and the second memory . 
>	1. Main Memory: Main memory is used to store the currently executing programms and datas 
>	2. Secondary Memory: is usually used to store data, and programs , for a long time , beca use they are non-volectile eg(Flash Cards,MMC,nvme etc)
>3. Powersupply
>4. Communication interface 
>5. Actuators 
>6. I/O Interafaces
>7. Peripherals
