# Embedded Systems

*It an Electro-mechanical which is a ==combination of software and hardware design(working together) to do a specific task==*
*It is any device that includes a programmable computer but is not itself intended to be a general-purpose computer. Thus, a PC is not itself an embedded computing system, although PCs are often used to build embedded computing systems. But a fax machine or a clock built from a microprocessor is an embedded computing system.*

### Q & A 
1.  Describe the principal features of the ARM architecture.
	- a large set of registers, all of which can be used for most purposes;
	- a load-store architecture;
	- ==3-address instructions== (that is, the two source operand registers and the result register are all independently specified);
	- ==conditional execution of every instruction==;
	- the inclusion of very powerful load and store multiple register instructions;
	- ==the ability to perform a general shift operation and a general ALU operation in a single instruction that executes in a single clock cycle==;
	- open instruction set extension through the coprocessor instruction set, including adding new registers and data types to the programmer's model. If the Thumb instruction set is considered part of the ARM architecture, we could also add:
	- a very dense 16-bit compressed representation of the instruction set in the Thumb architecture.
