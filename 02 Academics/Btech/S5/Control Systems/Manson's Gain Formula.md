# Manson's Gain Formula

$$
T = \frac{1}{\Delta} \sum_k P_k \Delta_k
$$
Where 
- $P_k$ -> forward pat gin of the $k^{th}$ path 
- $k$ -> no of forward path in a Signal flow graph
- $\Delta_k$ -> $\Delta$ for that path which is not touching the $k^{th}$ path

- [ ] $\Delta$ Equation complete3w
