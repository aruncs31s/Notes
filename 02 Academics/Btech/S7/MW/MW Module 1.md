# Module 1

- Basic antenna parameters: gain, directivity, beam width and effective aperture calculations, effective height, wave polarization, radiation resistance, radiation efficiency, antenna field zones.
- Duality and Principles of reciprocity
- Helmholtz theorem (derivation required)
- Field, directivity and radiation resistance of a short dipole and half wave dipole (far field derivation).
