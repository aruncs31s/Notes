### Antenna Parameters

1. **Directivity**

   $$
   D = \frac{4\pi U}{P_{rad}}
   $$

2. **Radiated Power**

   $$
   P_{rad} = P_{in} \times \eta
   $$

3. **Gain**
   $$
   G = \eta D
   $$

### Reciprocity Theorem

"If an emf is applied to the terminal of an antenna say antenna 1 and the current measured at terminal of another antenna say antenna 2 , then an equal current both in amplitude and phase will be obtained at the antenna 1 if the same emf is applied to the terminals of antenna no 1"

_The same antenna can be used for transmission and reception_
