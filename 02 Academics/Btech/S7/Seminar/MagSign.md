## 1. Introduction
- The rapid growth of **IoT devices**
- These IoT devices often **shares sensitive information**.
- Securing the sensitive information is essential
- **Authentication** is one way to protect 
- Need For **Better Authentication** Method
- The **MagSign** proposes a new authentication method that leverages the magnetic fields generated by electronic screens
So basically IoT is a name used to describe devices that has sensors and process data and they are connected to the internet. They are connected to the internet in the sense that they transmit or receive data from or to the internet. For Example now a days we have smart TV , smart light , smart almost everything. 
#### Rapid Growth of IoT Devices 
So IoT has gained mass  popularity and As we all know IoT device has been growing significantly over the years, almost 15% more than previous year and making it a total of 18.1 billion devices . 

#### These IoT Devices often share sensitive Information 
They share sensitive information in the sense that in in order to be smart it constantly collects data from the surroundings and send it to cloud. Some times these info that they sharing includes personal or sensitive details of the user. 

#### This Popularity also attracts Hackers
This massive gain in popularity also attracts hacker groups 

#### So Securing the sensitive information is essential 
Securing the sensitive information is very essential can reduce the chance of data breach. 

#### Need For better authentication 
Authentication is a way to protect the data from unauthorized user accessing it. But it also brings great computational complexity , so the devs often skips the complex part and employs a less complex password or authentication method which is not secure.

## 3. Need For Authentication
So what is the need for authentication 
- To protect sensitive information 
- To prevent unauthorized access 
- To prevent data breach

## 4. Drawbacks of existing tech
#### Limitations of Traditional Methods

- Traditional Authentication methods
  - Verity of devices -> Each having different operating system and different components
  - **Incompatibility** -> Traditional Auth methods like `passwords` ,`biometric`,`fingerprint` may not be compatible with all devices
  - **Limited User Interface**
    - Many Iot devices dont have a good `User Interface` Where they can interact
  - **Vulnerable to attack**
    - Passwords can be **stollen**
    - **Biometrics data Can be spoofed**
  - **High Resource Requirement**: The Amazon Echo requires $1GHz$ ARM processor and $256MB$ ram to support voice signal analysis
