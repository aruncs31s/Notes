# Seminar Report -> MagSign

## Introduction

> Internet of Things(IoT) devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet. And the number of IoT devices are kept increasing and they are becoming more and more interconnected. These devices often transmit sensitive information like **health information** bank details and other personal information. These type of information which they transmit attracts the hackers, if the devices are not secured properly they can steal the data and use it against the users. But Opting for a less secure option is also dangerous. Like **PIN** aka Personal Identification Number is less secure than a password or passphrase. Also there is a problem that most users don't even change the default password expose the device to the internet . Imagine an outsider accessing your CCTV because you did not change the default password.

> In the past years more and more authentication methods are being developed and widely used like fingerprint , face id etc. But they are very costly to actually implement like the Apple’s Face ID [^1] requires infrared cameras and flood light-sensing elements, greatly increasing hardware costs. Amazon Echo [^2] requires a 1 GHz ARM processor and 256MB RAM to support voice signal analysis .there are new type of authentication method such as password less authentication.
