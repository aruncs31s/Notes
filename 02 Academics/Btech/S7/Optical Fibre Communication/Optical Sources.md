# Optical Sources 
**Prerequisites**: [[Energy Bands]] , 

---

There are 2 widely used optical sources for OFC 
1. LED (Light Emitting Diodes)
	- Incoherent

1. ILD (Injection Laser Diode)
	- Coherent 
		- The optical energy produced is in a optical resonant cavity 
			- Which means that output is is highly **monochromatic** and **directional**
	- Hetero Junction structured 
		- Consist of 2 adjoining semiconductor materials with different bandgap energies
	- High Directive Output

## LED
- For speeds less than $100 - 200 \text{ Mbps}$
- In the context of Optical Fibre Communication system it requires less complex drive compared to laser diodes
-  No thermal regulator circuits are needed to maintain the temp

### LED Structure

- LED Must have high radiance(bright) output
>[!Note] Radiance
>It is a measure of optical power radiated into a single unit angle per unit area of the emitting surface. It is also known as the brightness of the source. Its unit is **Watts**

## Laser Diodes 
- For speeds greater than $100 - 200 \text{ Mbps}$
- highly directional 
- Highly monochromatic 

### Opration
Consists of 3 key process
1. Photon Absorrption
2. Spontaneous Emission
3. Stimulated Emission
