### 🧠 First principles

You’ve got **30 days**, **6 exams**, and **zero full days off**. So we can’t rely on long study marathons — we’ll go for **short, high-focus bursts**, supported by structure and rest.

Your energy, not time, is the bottleneck. So the plan will revolve around **maintaining mental sharpness**, not just clocking hours.

### ⏰ Step 1. Time audit (non-negotiable)

Work: 9 AM – 6 PM  
Add commute, meals, shower — say that’s another 2 hours total.  
So you have **roughly 6 AM – 8:30 AM** and **7 PM – 11 PM** as your usable window.  
That’s **6 hours per day**, but you can only sustain maybe **3.5–4 hours** of effective study if you’re working full-time.

We’ll work with that.

### 🗓 Step 2. Macro-plan (30-day structure)

|Phase|Days|Focus|
|---|---|---|
|**Phase 1: Mapping & Momentum**|1–5|Assess each subject, collect materials, identify weak zones, build schedule. Don’t cram yet.|
|**Phase 2: Core Study**|6–20|Deep work cycles per subject, 2 subjects in rotation every 3 days.|
|**Phase 3: Intensive Revision**|21–27|Condense notes, re-solve problems, simulate exam conditions.|
|**Phase 4: Taper & Rest**|28–30|Light revision + proper sleep before exams.|

### 📆 Step 3. Daily template

**Morning (6:00 – 8:30 AM)**

- 6:00–6:15 → Wake + stretch + coffee.
    
- 6:15–7:30 → _Deep Study Block 1_ (most demanding subject).
    
- 7:30–8:00 → Quick breakfast + prepare for work.
    
- 8:00–8:30 → _Light Review_ (flashcards, summary notes, commute listening if possible).
    

**Work (9:00 – 6:00)**

- Use **micro-breaks** for passive recall or spaced repetition (e.g., Anki or short notes on phone).
    
- Lunch: review one concept or past question.
    

**Evening (7:00 – 11:00 PM)**

- 7:00–7:30 → Dinner + decompress (avoid social media doomscroll).
    
- 7:30–9:00 → _Deep Study Block 2_ (different subject).
    
- 9:00–9:15 → Break.
    
- 9:15–10:30 → _Practice / Revision / Problem-solving_.
    
- 10:30–11:00 → Wind down, no screens, quick review of what you learned.
    

Sleep by **11:00–11:30 PM**. Don’t compromise sleep — it’s your memory’s write-to-disk phase.

### 🧩 Step 4. Weekly strategy

- **Rotate subjects every 3 days** to maintain freshness.
    
- Use **Sunday night** to re-plan the week and adjust.
    
- Every **7th evening**, take 2 hours _off_ — seriously. Burnout kills consistency faster than laziness.

### 🧠 Study method

- **Pomodoro but realistic:** 50 min focus, 10 min break.
    
- **Active recall + spaced repetition:** Don’t reread; quiz yourself.
    
- **Teach back:** If you can’t explain it out loud in simple terms, you don’t understand it.
    
- **Mind maps / condensed notes:** Especially useful during the final week.
    

---

### 🚀 Optional tweaks

- Use weekends (since you still work) for **mock tests** in the morning.
    
- If you can, negotiate for _one or two half-days off_ before the most difficult exam — it’s a huge multiplier.
    
- Cut low-value time (scrolling, chatting) mercilessly. Treat each hour as currency.

Would you like me to generate a **personalized 30-day timetable**, factoring in your **exam dates and subjects**?  
If you share:

1. Subject names
    
2. Exam order/dates (if known)
    
3. Which ones you find hardest
    

…I can build you a custom adaptive plan that fits your exact schedule.
