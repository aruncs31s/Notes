The past, is everything we were  
Don't make us who we are

So I'll dream, until I make it real  
And all I see is stars

Turning dust to gold

And we'll dream

It possible  
  
I will chase, I will reach, I will fly  
Until I'm Breaking, Until I'm Breaking

Out of my cage, like a bird in the night  
I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
> When you don't care about what other people think about you , you can unleash your full potential, its like when you are inside a mask , no one will no what you do , but its lot harder without the mask , because everyone is gonna judge you , so always do without the mask , be you.


In, into something big  
Better than before

And if it takes, takes a thousand lives  
Then it's worth fighting for  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
> If something seems much harder and you sacrifice lot for it , then it's worth fighting for , like some things , no matter how hard you try, its just not seems to work , but never give up on things like that , you will never know what's on the other end.

From the bottom to the top  
We're sparking wild fires  
Never quit and never stop  
The rest of our lives  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>The term we used has to much importance , its like when someone said 
>"If you want to walk fast walk alone , but if you want to walk far , walk together." , greatest things always achieved as a group , but always remember most of the time , there is always one man or women , who started all this.
