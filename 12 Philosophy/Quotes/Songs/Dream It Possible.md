# Dream It Possible

***I will run, I will climb, I will soar***  
***I'm undefeated, ooh***  
>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>"Undefeated" isn’t about never losing; it’s about refusing to stay down

***Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord***  
***Yeah I believe it, ooh***  
>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>not staying inside a box and exploring new things

***The past, is everything we were***  
***Don't make us who we are***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>We are not defined by our mistakes, it's okay to blame us for mistakes, but the greatest thing to do is to accept the mistakes and move on.

***So I'll dream, until I make it real***  
***And all I see is stars***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>When you really want something , all you do is dream about it every single day , until its real and no longer just a dream, its when dream come to reality. And when we are working on our dreams we no longer see the problems we face as set backs , we see them as challenges that need to be solved. 

***It's not until you fall that you fly***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
> "If you do what you do, you get what you get." You will always achieve that extra when you do what other people don't, and everyone is scared at first, but the fear did not come to stay, it came to test whether you really, actually want this.

***When your dreams come***  
***Alive you're unstoppable***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
> When your dreams comes true , you will be just unstoppable , you will feel it when you get to that point.

***Take a shot, chase the***  
***Sun, find the beautiful***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>Never be afraid to take risks , there is nothing you gain from not taking risks , and never even think about backup plans , just always put your 100.

***We will glow in the dark***  
***Turning dust to gold***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>When you do what you always said, you even inspire the people around you , and its no longer you its just us, they all share the same dream and shine as bright as gold.

And we'll dream  
It possible  
Possible, ooh  
And we'll dream  
It possible  
  
***I will chase, I will reach, I will fly***  
***Until I'm Breaking, Until I'm Breaking***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>I will do what I want until every cell in my body is tired, and never going to rest.
>"Rest in the end, not in the middle"

***Out of my cage, like a bird in the night***  
***I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
> When you don't care about what other people think about you, you can unleash your full potential. It's like when you are inside a mask, no one will know what you do, but it's a lot harder without the mask, because everyone is gonna judge you, so always do without the mask—be you.

***In, into something big***  
***Better than before***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
> Never compare yourself to others, compare your own versions, how much I have improved from time to time, and never stay down.

***And if it takes, takes a thousand lives***  
***Then it's worth fighting for***  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
> If something seems much harder and you sacrifice a lot for it, then it's worth fighting for, like some things, no matter how hard you try, it just doesn't seem to work, but never give up on things like that, you will never know what's on the other end.

It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come  
Alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot, chase the  
Sun, find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark  
Turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream  
It possible, ooooh  
It possible, oh, ooh  
  
***From the bottom to the top***  
***We're sparking wild fires***  
***Never quit and never stop***  
***The rest of our lives.***

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>The term we used has to much importance , its like when someone said 
>"If you want to walk fast walk alone , but if you want to walk far , walk together." , greatest things always achieved as a group , but always remember most of the time , there is always one man or women , who started all this. 
>and **Never Quit** and **Never Stop**, often we stop all this when we get old, but if you really think about *we only get old if we stop trying*, *age begins when the learning stops.*
