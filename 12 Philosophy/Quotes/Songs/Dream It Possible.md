I will run, I will climb, I will soar  
I'm undefeated, ooh  
>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>"Undefeated" isn’t about never losing; it’s about refusing to stay down


**Jumping out of my skin, pull the chord**  
**Yeah I believe it, ooh**  
>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>not , staying inside a box and explore new thing


The past, is everything we were  
Don't make us who we are  

>[!abstract]- *Explanation*
>We are not defined by our mistakes, it's okey to blame us for mistake , but the greatest thing to do is , to accept the mistakes and move on. 



So I'll dream, until I make it real  
And all I see is stars  

>[!abstract]*Explanation*
>When you really want something , all you do is dream about it 



It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come  
Alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot, chase the  
Sun, find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark  
Turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream  
It possible  
Possible, ooh  
And we'll dream  
It possible  
  
I will chase, I will reach, I will fly  
Until I'm Breaking, Until I'm Breaking  
Out of my cage, like a bird in the night  
I know I'm changing, I know I'm changing  
In, into something big  
Better than before  
And if it takes, takes a thousand lives  
Then it's worth fighting for  
  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
When your dreams come  
Alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot, chase the  
Sun, find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark  
Turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream  
It possible, ooooh  
It possible, oh, ooh  
  
From the bottom to the top  
We're sparking wild fires  
Never quit and never stop  
The rest of our lives  
From the bottom to the top  
We're sparking wild fires  
Never quit and never stop  
It's not until you fall that you fly  
  
When your dreams come  
Alive you're unstoppable  
Take a shot, chase the  
Sun, find the beautiful  
We will glow in the dark  
Turning dust to gold  
And we'll dream  
It possible  
Possible, ooh  
And we'll dream  
It possible
