# AI-Assistant UI
- [[09 Startups/ESDC-GCEK/Projects/AI-Assistant/Teams/Teams|Teams]]
This Project is mainly to provide an interactive, User Interface for the Users and Developers.

## Features 
- It should store the most recently asked questions and answers 
- It should show Robot status , such as current position remaining charge if it runs on battery
- Can suggest any.

### Touch UI 
I have not yet decided , which to go with like  , the robot runs on raspberry pi so we can either use a custom linux app made using flutter or something or , we can use a **Touch Screen LCD** display. Both of them costs the same. 
But In the case of HDMI Screens which will be driven by the PI itself and In the case of, Touch screen **Micro Controller** like [[08 Electronics/Embedded Systems/Micro Controllers/Espressif/ESP32/ESP32|ESP32]] will drive the screen
### WebUI
- The robot will also provide a webui for remote management as well as touch screen for controlling 

- [[Server]]
