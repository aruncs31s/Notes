## 📈 Architecture At a Glance

```
Traditional Approach:          Modular Approach:
src/pages/                     src/modules/
├── CourseDetail.tsx           ├── courses/
├── Products.tsx               │   ├── pages/
├── ...                        │   ├── components/
src/components/                │   ├── services/
├── Login.tsx                  │   ├── hooks/
├── Register.tsx               │   ├── types/
├── ...                        │   └── styles/
src/hooks/                     ├── auth/ (coming)
├── useAuth.ts                 ├── user/ (coming)
└── ...                        └── shared/ (coming)

❌ Hard to navigate            ✅ Clear organization
❌ Code scattered              ✅ Code colocated
❌ Difficult to scale          ✅ Easy to scale
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Module Structure
Each module has:
- **pages/** - Page components
- **components/** - Reusable components
- **services/** - Business logic
- **hooks/** - Custom React hooks
- **types/** - TypeScript interfaces
- **styles/** - CSS files
- **index.ts** - Public API (exports)

### Service Pattern
```typescript
class CourseService {
  static getAllCourses(): Course[] { ... }
  static getCourseById(id): Course { ... }
  static markVideoWatched(progress, id): void { ... }
  // ... 12+ static methods
}
```

### Hook Pattern
```typescript
function useCourseProgress(courseId) {
  const [progress, setProgress] = useState(...);
  // ... logic
  return { progress, markVideoWatched, ... };
}
```
