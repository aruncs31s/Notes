## Organization Principles

1. **Numbered System**: Main content uses a two-digit numbering system (00-17) for logical ordering
2. **Special Numbers**: Numbers 90+ are reserved for utility, archive, and special-purpose directories
3. **Consistent Naming**: Directory names follow the pattern `[Number] [Category Name]`
4. **Logical Grouping**: Related content is grouped under appropriate main categories
5. **No Duplicates**: Each category has a single, authoritative location

## Available Numbers

Currently available numbers for new categories: `04`, `18-96`

## File Organization

- Each directory may contain subdirectories for further organization
- Markdown files (.md) are the primary content format
- Excalidraw files (.excalidraw.md) for diagrams and drawings
- Attachments and media files are stored in appropriate subdirectories
