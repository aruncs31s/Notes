# Energy Bands
1. Valance Band : Where the valance electron occupy
2. Conduction Band : Higher Energy level Band 
These two energy bands are separated by a **band gap** for **Si** Band Gap = $1.1eV$- When an electron leaves from valance band it leave p (hole) in the valance band

### Intrinsic Carrier Concentration 
Concentration of electrons and holes is known as **Intrinsic Carrier Concentration** $n_{i}$ 
For a perfect material 

$$
n = p = n_{i} = K \exp\left( - \frac{ E_{g}}{2K_{B} T }\right)
$$
$$
K = 2( 2\pi K_{B} T / h^2 )^{3/2} (m_{e} m_{h} )^{3/4}
$$



### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Material 
>Intrinsic Material : A Perfect material which contains no impurities 

>Extrinsic Material : a material which contains impurity 


### Mass Action Law 
- [ ] Need to find out why 
$$
np = n_{i}^2
$$


### Direct and Indirect Bandgaps
