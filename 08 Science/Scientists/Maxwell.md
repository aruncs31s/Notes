# Maxwell
## Maxwell's Equations 
Voltages and currents of the related electronic components can be significantly altered by adjusting screen contents

This process is accompanied by the mutual conversion of electricity and magnetism as defined on Maxwell Equations

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot E &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{o}}  \tag{Gauss Law}\\
\nabla \cdot B &= 0 \tag{Gauss Law For Magnettism}\\
\nabla \times E &= \frac{ - \partial B}{\partial t} \tag{Faraday's Law}\\
\nabla \times B &= \mu_{o} \left(J + \epsilon_{0} \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} \right) \tag{Ampere's Law }
\end{align}
$$

- The interplay between **electricity** and **magnetism** is governed by **Maxwell's Equations**
- This equation states that ==a time-varying electric field or current (denoted by $ùêΩ$) generates a magnetic field==. Specifically, 

### Gauss's Law for Electricity. 
$$
\nabla \cdot E = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_{o}}  
$$
- Left side we have  **[[Divergence]]** of [[01 Academics/Btech/S6/ElectroMagnetics/Electromagnetics#^a4c15d|Electric Field]] 

*It says that electric flux through closed surface is proportional to total charge enclosed by that surface *

$$
\oint \overrightarrow E \cdot \overrightarrow {dA} = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_{0}} 
$$
Where 
- $\epsilon_{0}$ is the permittivity[^1] of free space 

[^1]: Capability of a vacuum to permit electric field 
### $\nabla \cdot B = 0$
- It says that [[Divergence]] of a magnetic field is zero
There are couple of things that can get from this equation like , there is no ==source== or ==sink== in magnetic field . Also there is no magnet with ==monopole==, ie if we cut a magnet in half we will get a new magnet with north and south pole
