# MG995
## Features (Source 1)

^ae27f8

- Metal geared servo for more life ^035d79
- Stable and shock proof double ball bearing design
- High speed rotation for quick response
- Fast control response
- Constant torque throughout the servo travel range
- Excellent holding power
- Weight: 55 g
- Dimension: 40.7×19.7×42.9mm
- Operating voltage range: 4.8 V to 7.2 V
- Stall torque: 9.4kg/cm (4.8v); 11kg/cm (6v)
- Operating speed: 0.2 s/60º (4.8 V), 0.16 s/60º (6 V)
- Rotational degree: 180º
- Dead band width: 5 μs
- Operating temperature range: 0ºC to +55ºC
- Current draw at idle: 10mA
- No load operating current draw: 170mA
- Current at maximum load: 1200mA

## PWM Values

^867e71

- Frequency of PWM: MG995 takes in PWM signal of frequency 50Hz and any higher and lower frequency PWM will lead to error. As shown in figure the every single cycle of PWM needs to be 20ms width for 50Hz frequency. ^17d14e
- Duty cycle of PWM: The duty cycle of PWM (or ratio of ON time to total cycle time) determines the position of servo axis. If we provide a PWM signal of 0.5ms ON time over 20mS complete cycle, the servo axis will move to 0º

## Interfacing
```cpp
#include <Servo.h>
Servo S1; 
void setup() {
	  S1.attach(9);  
}
void loop() {
	  for (int angle = 0; angle <= 180; angle++) {
	    S1.write(angle);    
	    delay(15);         
	  }
	  for (int angle = 180; angle >= 0; angle--) {
	    S1.write(angle);
	    delay(15);
	  }
}
```
