# Shannon-Hartely Theorem
"In information theory, the Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem tells the maximum rate at which information can be transmitted over a communications channel of a specified bandwidth in the presence of noise."^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem]
 "The Capacity of a band limited [[Gausiann Channel]] with [[AWGN]] is given by"

noise (AWGN) is given by 
$$
C = B \log\left(1 + \frac{S}{N} \right) \tag{bits/sec} 
$$

^226bce

- C -> Capacity
- B -> Channel Bandwidth in Hz
- S -> Signal Power in Watts 
- N -> Noise power in Watts 
So it give the channel capacity of a band limited Gaussian Channel With AWGN  ?
- [ ] What is Gaussian Channel
#proof 


## Equation Analysis 
	In the  equation the channel capacity $C$ can not be changed  ![[#^226bce]]
