# Constellation Points 
"Most digital modulation schemes involve a discrete number of symbols which are used to convey information. These symbols are mapped to a discrete set of magnitude and phase values on the I/Q plane, which are referred to as constellation points"

**The greater the number of Constellation points the greater the number of bits per symbol**

The I/Q values translate magnitude and phase information of a signal into a simple rectangular, linear set of values which simplify the associated signal processing.



[^1]: Two signals are said to be in “quadrature” when they are separated in phase by exactly 90°. [Source](https://nuwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/AN-005-Constellation-Diagrams-and-How-They-Are-Used1.pdf)
