### Fourier Series

The Fourier series is a mathematical tool used to ==represent a periodic function as the sum of simple sine and cosine functions==. It is named after Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, who introduced the concept in the early 19th century. The Fourier series is particularly useful for ==analyzing signals that are periodic in nature==.
`FS` is represented by $f(t)$ with time period $T$ and it is equal to

$$
f(t) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[a_n \cos(n\omega_0 t) + b_n \sin(n\omega_0 t)\right]
$$

or

$$
x(t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty X[k]e^{jk\omega_0t}
$$

and

$$
X[k] = {1 \over T} \int_{(t)} x(t)e^{-j\omega_0t} dt
$$

> [!IMPORTANT|right] Applicability
> `Fourier Series` is only used for periodic signals

$x(t)$ has period T and $\omega_0 = {2 \pi \over T}$

### Discrete-Time Fourier Series

$$
x[n] = \sum_{K=0}^{N} X[k]e^{j\Omega_0 n}
$$

$$
X = {1 \over N} \sum_{n=0}^{N} x[n]e^{-jk\Omega_0n}
$$

_$x[n]$ and $X[k]$ have period $N$_

$$
\Omega_0 = {2 \pi \over N}
$$

### Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique used in signal processing and image analysis, among other fields, ==to transform a function of time (a signl) into a function of frequency==

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt\
$$

- $F(\omega)$ Fourier transform coefficient of $f(t)$
- $\omega$ is the Frequency
  or
  $$
  F(f) = \int f (t) e^{- j 2 \pi f t } dt
  $$

#### Inverse Fourier Transform

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{j\omega t} d
\omega\
$$

### Discrete Time Fourier Transform

The discrete time fourier transform of $x[n]$ is

$$
X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n = -\infty} ^ {\infty} x[n] e^{-j \omega n}
$$

### Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT)

- **DFT** of a finite duration sequence $x[n]$ is obtained by sampling **[[#Discrete-Time Fourier Transform|DTFT]]** at **N** equally spaced points over the interval $0\le \omega \le 2\pi$ with spacing $2\pi \over N$

> [!NOTE] Spacing
> The Spacing in the [[#Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT)|DFT]] increases with decrease in the no of sampling points taken , if the N = 4 , The points will be $\large0,{\pi\over 2},\pi,{3 \pi \over 2}$
>
> - The N points should be located at $$\omega_k = {2\pi \over N} k$$ ,where $k = 1,2,3,.....,N-1$

### Fast Fourier Transform(FFT)

_It is an algorithm that is used to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform Faster _

```
graph LR
A[Signal In time] -- FFT --->B[Signal in Freq]

```

- the x-axis of freq domain will be sample rate ?

![negative freq.png](assets/imgs/negative%20freq.png)

> $100Mhz$ with sample rate of $10Mhz$ will result in $105Mhz$ and $95Mhz$

#### FFT In python

```python
import numpy as np

t = np.arange(100)
s = np.sin(0.15 * 2 * np.pi * t)
S = np.fft.fftshift(np.fft.fft(s))
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

S_mag = np.abs(S)
S_phase = np.angle(S)
plt.plot(t, S_mag, ".-")
plt.plot(t, S_phase, ".-")
plt.show()
```
