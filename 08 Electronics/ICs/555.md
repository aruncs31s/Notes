It is the internal diagram of the 555 timer in which 
1. 3 5k resistors are used hence the name 555 timer 
	- [[#Voltage Devider]]
1. there are 2 Comparators and 2 transistors
	1. **Upper Comparator** and **Lower Comparator** 
	2. Discharge transistor(**Q1**) and the output transistor(**Q2**)
2. There is a **SR Flip Flop** 
	- when the ouput of SR is low the output of the timer is high
	- when the output of SR is high the output of the timer is low
> Because between the **SR Flip Flops** output and the **Timers** output there is a kind of Not gate (**Inverter**)
4. The output of the Comparator is connected to the **SR Flip Flop
	- Output of **Upper Comparator** is connected  to the `Set`(**S**) of the SR Flip Flop 
	- Output of **Lower Comparator** is connected to the `Reset`(**R**) of the SR Flip Flop

#### Voltage Divider 
>[!blank|right-small]
>![[555 timer internal Voltage devider.excalidraw|200x200|Voltage Devider]]

- There is a 3 5K resistor in connected in series 
- In this the $\frac{2}{3}V_{cc}$ is connected to the **Inverting terminal** of the **Upper Comparator** 
- And the $\frac{1}{3}V_{cc}$ is connected to the **Non inverting(Positive)**  terminal of the **Lower Comparator**

*Why this is important one may ask*
> It is important because for **comparators** in which the comparison happens and 
> - if the voltage at the **Non inverting** terminal is greater than the voltage at the **inverting** terminal then the output goes to **+Vsat** 
> - if the voltage at the **Inverting** terminal is greater than the **Non Inverting** terminal then the output goes to **-Vsat**

> - ==The voltage devider sets the threshold voltage for the comparators==

### Working 
1. Initially the **output of the the timer is low**
2. When the output is low **Q1**(as i call it discharge transistor) is on 
	- The *Q1's base is connected to the output of the SR flip flop* so when the **output is zero then the output of SR FF is one** which turns on the Q1
3. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_c  &= V_{cc} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2} = \frac{2}{3} V_{cc} \\
&t = T , V_c =  \frac{2}{3} V_{cc} \\

\therefore V_c &= V_{cc} \times \left(1-e^{-\large{\frac{T}{R_C}}}\right) \\
\therefore T &= RC \ln \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 1.1 RC 
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\color{cyan}\large {\boxed{T = 1.1 RC}}

### Example Design 
**Monostable Multi-Vibrator** with **T** = 3ms

> Let $T = 3 ms$ ,  $C = 0.1\micro F$ 
> Then by [[#^fa4314|This equation]] we have $R = \large \frac{T}{1.1C}$  
> $R = \frac{3 \times 10^{-3}}{1.1 \times 0.1 \times 10^{-6}} = 27.27 K\Omega$
