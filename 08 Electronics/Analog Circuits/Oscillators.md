# Oscillators   
Oscillators make use of **Oscillation** eg: output going **+** and **-**
- Oscillation Results from **unstable state** which is because "the feedback system can’t find a stable state because its transfer function can’t be satisfied" [^1]
> For example ![[Feedback Circuits#^d0e9e2]] this equation becomes unstable when the $A\beta=-1$ , ie the value of $G$ will be $\infty$ when denominator is zero , due to the oscillator works in because of the instable state the circuit have to be unstable ,and follow the **Barkhausen criterion**

>[!float|right-small] Barkhausen criterion
>The loop gain must be **unity** or greater
>The feedback signal feeding back at the input must be phase-shifted by 360°($2\pi$) (or zero degrees
