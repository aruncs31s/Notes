*are formed by the junction of a semiconductor material with a piece of metal* . *switch on and off much faster than traditional PN junction diodes*
- lower forward voltage drop
- the Schottky diode doesnâ€™t get as hot as a regular diode
- carry more current 

>[!Note] Threshold Voltage(Knee voltage)
>When i test the threshold voltage using multimeter in **diode mode**  it showd $0.195V$ usually a **silicon diode** shows $0.6V$
