# Using Inverse Kinematics

Today **2025-06-23** we tried using Trignometric Functions , and it is found that

1. The angle required for the first movement in walk is
   `left_hip_angle = 28.5` # without the offset
   `left_tight_shing_joint = 12`

So if we add `offset`[^1] to that we can get

$$
\text{left_hip_angle} = 28.5 + 130 = 158
$$

$$
\text{left_tight_shing_joint} =
$$

[^1]: the initial_angle is considerd as the offset
