**Aim**: 
>**Revision 1**:
>- Measure the voltage using a Micro-Controller and show that on a website 
>**Revision 2**:
>*{extends the Revision 1}*
>- Measure the voltage as well as the rain volume 
>**Revision 3**:
>*{extends the Revision 2}*>
>- WebSite should include a relay which control the `stree light ` 

>[!Note|right-small] Relay Module 
>Note that i have used 2 channel relay module because by the time i only have 2 channel relay module and it can be also used to control additional load ;

### Components Used
- There are 2 revisions for this project
  1. Using [[08 Electronics/Embedded Systems/Micro Controllers/Espressif/ESP32/ESP32|ESP32]]
  2. Using [[ESP8266]]

*This is just initial cost for testing and prototype and does not reflect on the actual cost of the final project , for example `esp32` is in the first table costs `546/-` INR   Which can be reduced also if we're planning to use `ESP8266` the cost will be even less but we will be only getting 1 [[03 Electronics/Embedded Systems/Micro Controllers/Espressif/ESP32 1/programming/Analog Interfacing|ADC]] Pin*
