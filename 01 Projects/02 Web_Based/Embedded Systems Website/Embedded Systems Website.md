## Introduction 
This project aims to develop a website where , GCEK Embedded Systems students can show case their projects and hopefully products that they develop in the future. 
So what do you need , if you are planning to contribute read the [[#Contribute Section]] 
## Contribution
Contribution might be the hardest that me can ask. But also the beautiful thing , because you will never learn things if you don't try , and always remember to grow , you don't have to remember it you will do that eventually. This all might sound like some gimic , i don't know how to convince otherwise. 
As i have said contribution might be the hardest because , 
1. You have to learn , Astro , [[React]] , Javascript , and HTML + CSS and Tailwind. 
**what i have to say about it.**
I don't know any of it , except JS ,HTML , CSS , so how can i do this?. The obvious answer would be to use chatgpt.

>[!Note] **Note on ChatGPT**
>Using AI tools like , ChatGPT , Gemini , Claude etc..  is ok but there are some problems which comes with it if you don't know how to use it. 
>1. You will get codebanged , which means the codebase will become , so large that you might use complex design patterns to implement simple functions and use of outdated libraries. 
>2. You will lose the ability to read , and understand the code. **Why?**
>It has to do with how to learn code, by using what i've learned over the years , that you learn code mostly by doing, so you have to get your hands dirty, think of it like
