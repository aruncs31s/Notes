# Walking

The key to walking is to adjust the center of mass.

- servo torque limits?
  `

```cpp
void WalkForward(){
}
```

## Human Walking (Bipedal walking)

**Humanoid walking involves:**

1. Alternating leg movements (gait cycle)
2. Weight shifting between legs
3. Arm swinging for balance
4. Center of gravity management

### 1. The Gait Cycle

```mermaid

gait --> Swing_Phase & Stance_Phase
```

#### Stance Phase (60%)

In this the foot is in contact with the ground

- Initial contact (heel strike)
- Loading response (foot flat)
- Mid-stance
- Terminal stance (heel off)
- Pre-swing (toe off)

#### Swing Phase (40%)

Foot is not in contact with the ground

- Initial swing
- Mid-swing
- Late swing

### 2. Weight Shifting

### 3. Arm Swing

![[#^80cec7]]

- each arm swings with the motion of the **opposing** leg
- Swinging arms in an opposing direction with respect to the lower limb reduces the angular momentum of the body, balancing the rotational motion produced during walking
- As the walking speed increases, the amplitude of the arm swing increases accordingly.
- **Why**
  the leg swing results in an angular momentum that is balanced by the ground reaction moments on the stance foot. Swinging arms create an angular momentum in the opposing direction of lower limb rotation, reducing the total angular momentum of the body. Lower angular momentum of the body results in a decline on the ground reaction moment on the stance foot

### 4. Center of Gravity Management

Managing Center of Gravity (COG) crucial for maintaining balance and preventing falls. _By positioning the Center of Gravity over the base of support (feet)_

## Robot Walking

We Need to calculate the **Hip** **Knee** and **Ankle** angles for each leg to achieve walking motion.
x, y, z represents foot position relative to the hip joint.

```cpp
void calculateLegIK(float x, float y, float z, float &hipAngle, float &kneeAngle, float &ankleAngle) {
    // Convert from 3D space to servo angles
    float legLength = sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z);
    float alpha = acos((thighLength*thighLength + shinLength*shinLength - legLength*legLength) / (2*thighLength*shinLength));
    kneeAngle = 180 - alpha * RAD_TO_DEG;

    float beta = acos((thighLength*thighLength + legLength*legLength - shinLength*shinLength) / (2*thighLength*legLength));
    hipAngle = atan2(x, sqrt(y*y + z*z)) * RAD_TO_DEG + beta * RAD_TO_DEG;

    ankleAngle = atan2(y, z) * RAD_TO_DEG - hipAngle;
}
```

Leg Length

$$
\text{Leg Lenght} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

ðŸ¦µ Has Parts

1. Thigh
2. Shin
3. Foot

Thigh -> it length `thighLength`
