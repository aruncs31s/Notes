# Flutter Battery Monitor App
- [[Battery Level]]

## Project Overview
A Flutter-based battery monitoring application that tracks battery consumption, displays charts, and provides detailed analytics for mobile devices. Built on top of a fitness app UI template and converted into a comprehensive battery management solution.

**Project Location:** `c:\Users\arunc\Git\Android\Best-Flutter-UI-Templates\fitness_app_standalone`

## Implementation Summary

### Features Implemented ✅
- **SQLite Database Integration** - Local data persistence for battery and app usage data
- **Real-time Battery Monitoring** - Continuous tracking of battery level, status, and consumption
- **Interactive Charts** - Line charts for consumption trends and pie charts for app usage distribution
- **Battery Status Widget** - Live display of current battery level and charging status
- **Sample Data Generation** - Automatic seeding of demo data for testing
- **Responsive UI** - Integrated battery widgets into existing fitness app screens

### Technical Architecture

#### Database Layer
**File:** `lib/services/database_helper.dart`
- **Database:** SQLite with `sqflite` package
- **Tables:**
  - `battery_data` - Stores battery level, status, temperature, timestamp, consumption rate
  - `app_usage_data` - Stores app name, package name, usage time, battery consumption
- **Features:** Auto-increment IDs, date range queries, cleanup utilities

```sql
-- Battery Data Schema
CREATE TABLE battery_data(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  battery_level INTEGER NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  temperature REAL NOT NULL,
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
  consumption_rate INTEGER NOT NULL
);

-- App Usage Data Schema  
CREATE TABLE app_usage_data(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  app_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  package_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  usage_time INTEGER NOT NULL,
  timestamp TEXT NOT NULL,
  battery_consumption REAL NOT NULL
);

```

#### Data Models
**File:** `lib/models/battery_data.dart`
- **BatteryData Model** - Battery level, status, temperature, timestamp, consumption rate
- **AppUsageData Model** - App name, package name, usage time, battery consumption
- **Features:** JSON serialization (toMap/fromMap), type-safe field definitions

#### Service Layer
**File:** `lib/services/battery_service.dart`
- **BatteryService (Singleton)** - Core battery monitoring service
- **Features:**
  - Timer-based monitoring (every 30 seconds)
  - Real-time battery state reading via `battery_plus` package
  - Consumption rate calculation
  - Broadcast streams for UI updates
  - Historical data retrieval

**File:** `lib/services/sample_data_service.dart`
- **Sample Data Generation** - Creates realistic demo data
- **Features:** Battery history simulation, app usage patterns, one-time initialization

#### UI Components

**Battery Status Widget**
**File:** `lib/fitness_app/ui_view/battery_status_view.dart`
- Compact card showing current battery level and status
- Real-time updates via stream subscription
- Integrated into diary screen

**Consumption Graph**
**File:** `lib/fitness_app/ui_view/consumption_graph_view.dart`
- Line chart displaying battery level over last 24 hours
- Built with `fl_chart` package
- Interactive tooltips and grid lines

**App Usage Graph**  
**File:** `lib/fitness_app/ui_view/app_usage_graph_view.dart`
- Pie chart showing battery consumption by app
- Color-coded sections with percentage labels
- Top 8 apps display with overflow handling

#### Integration Points
**File:** `lib/fitness_app/my_diary/my_diary_screen.dart`
- Added battery status and chart widgets to main screen
- Proper animation sequencing
- Service initialization and cleanup

**File:** `lib/main.dart`
- App startup initialization
- Sample data seeding
- Battery service startup

### Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  sqflite: ^2.3.0      # SQLite database
  path: ^1.8.3         # Path utilities
  fl_chart: ^0.68.0    # Chart library
  battery_plus: ^5.0.0 # Battery status API

```

### Code Quality Status
**Last Analyzer Run:** 122 issues (mostly deprecation warnings and style lints)
- ✅ No blocking compilation errors
- ✅ All new features compile successfully  
- ⚠️ Legacy UI code has deprecation warnings (`withOpacity` → `withValues`)
- ⚠️ Some style lints (private types in public API, unnecessary constructors)

## Development Process

### Initial Request
User requested: "check all code and create a sqlite database to store the data and add a graph to show consumption"

### Implementation Steps
1. **Project Analysis** - Explored existing Flutter fitness app template structure
2. **Database Design** - Created schema for battery and app usage data  
3. **Service Implementation** - Built singleton services for data management
4. **UI Integration** - Added charts and status widgets to existing screens
5. **Testing & Debugging** - Fixed import errors, model conflicts, and syntax issues
6. **Code Cleanup** - Resolved name collisions and import dependencies

### Key Challenges Solved
- **Model Name Collision** - Renamed UI `AppUsageData` to `AppUsageCardData` to avoid conflict with service model
- **Import Dependencies** - Fixed missing imports for `BatteryStatusView`
- **Malformed Models** - Corrected syntax errors in model constructors and field definitions
- **Template Dependencies** - Converted external package references to local relative imports

### Testing Strategy
- **Static Analysis** - Used `flutter analyze` iteratively to catch errors
- **Dependency Validation** - Verified `flutter pub get` successful execution
- **Runtime Ready** - All critical compilation errors resolved

## Usage Instructions

### Running the App

```bash
cd 'c:\Users\arunc\Git\Android\Best-Flutter-UI-Templates\fitness_app_standalone'
flutter pub get
flutter run

```

### Key Screens
- **My Diary Screen** - Main screen with battery status and consumption charts
- **Battery Status Card** - Shows current level and charging status
- **Consumption Graph** - 24-hour battery level trend line
- **App Usage Chart** - Pie chart of battery consumption by app

### Data Flow
1. **BatteryService** monitors device battery every 30 seconds
2. **DatabaseHelper** stores readings in SQLite tables
3. **UI Widgets** query service for historical data and live updates
4. **Charts** render data using `fl_chart` library components

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add battery health predictions
- [ ] Implement charging optimization suggestions  
- [ ] Add export functionality for battery data
- [ ] Create battery usage notifications
- [ ] Add dark mode support for charts
- [ ] Implement data backup/restore features
