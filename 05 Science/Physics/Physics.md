#### Forces

> [!INFO] Strong Nuclear Force
> We know **similar** charges repel each other and **opposite** charges attract eachother but  why the protons inside and atom not repelling each other ? 
> - One thing that the strong Nuclear force experienced by protons and nutrons so the `strong nuclear force` will exceed force experienced due to the charges(electric force)

The vector itself is independant of which co-ordinate system we use.

#### Laws of Co-varients
Laws of physics will stay the same even if you change the references. 

1. Translation Symmetry of the universe -> Conservation of Momentum
2. Rotational Symmetry of the universe ->  Conservation of angular momentum

- [ ] time? .
3. Time Symmetry -> Conservation of energy
But our universe is not symmetric in time. as a result everything will lose it's energy over time. 
But it is only noticeable in large scale of time , for small reference of time this effect wont be noticed.

**Principle of Least action?**
