## Lyrics 


_[Intro: Claret Jai]_  
The poor stays poor the rich get richer it's just so disproportionate.  
Get outta here!  
  
_[Hook: Claret Jai]_  
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate, that's why I don't give a shit  
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer, it's just so disproportionate  
**You don't know just what I go through, that's why I would rather show you**  
**Just how far that I can take it, every rule I'm breaking it**  
  
_[Verse 1: Eminem]_  
Tearible but not rippable, invincible, I hung invisible  
Fuckin' mistletoe, over the world and stuck my ass up under it  
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it hoes, here we go  
Bad and Evil, so you know how this'll go  
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no, joke  
Goin' overboard, like someone threw us off the boat, choke  
Cough from all the smoke I'm tryna stay on fire  
So you know if I hate fuckin' water-sprinklers I don't love the hose  
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff his face  
Back in that bitch, smother that little mothafucka 'til it suffocates  
Who? You! Had long enough of a wait  
Why are they tryin' to be so secretive bad and evil is reunited hey!  
Came back to annihilate the game's in dire straights,  
As I await, word of Satan as I drop,  
Fall to my knees before this Ouija board,  
And I pray, now I lay me down to sleep  
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin' now imagine if I awake  
I'm champ bitch, I'll never taste the canvas  
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mooshy, so you can't squoosh  
No way near toosh in fact if I jump out a bush  
These sneak attack's the only way I say I ambush  
Outlandish these words are weapons that I brandish  
Standoffish the hoes, keep your hands off this  
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?  
Law, fuck protocol, I'd holla at this ho, but now my throat is sore  
  
_[Hook: Claret Jai]_  
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate, that's why I don't give a shit  
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer, it's just so disproportionate  
You don't know just what I go through, that's why I would rather show you  
Just how far that I can take it, every rule I'm breaking it  
  
_[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]_  
Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me  
I'm at your homey, I'm at your home ready to spray you  
While you nappin' homie Have everything on and around your mattress  
Lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony, you high? Thug yeah  
Go 'head jump, no matter how high you get  
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb  
My DUI's get waved like sayin' bye  
Still ridin' with no L's like James Todd, can't change I  
I thank God for my safe thinking  
Last time I was safe thinkin me and my niggas was doin' a bank job  
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route  
You got a mouth like Kanye, I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out  
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine  
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like da line  
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough  
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left or right, head or gut?  
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave fubar  
Fucked up beyond all recognition  
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite  
I could just throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it  
Partner you not hard up-outta ya high bars  
Beef has left you prayin' right? Like Allah hu Akbar!  
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your metro  
In a bad area that call drop  
  
_[Hook: Claret Jai]_  
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate, that's why I don't give a shit  
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer, it's just so disproportionate  
You don't know just what I go through, that's why I would rather show you  
Just how far that I can take it, every rule I'm breaking it
