# Mock Testing
In Go, the `go test` command identifies test files based on their filename pattern: any file that ends with `_test.go` is considered a test file. These files typically contain test functions (which must start with `Test` and take a `*testing.T` parameter), benchmark functions (starting with `Benchmark`), and other testing-related code
