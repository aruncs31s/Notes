## Error handling
```python
try:
	somecode()
except SomeError:
		print("Error")
finally:
	print("Always executed")
```

#eg
```python
try:
    file = open('example.txt', 'r')
    content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("The file was not found.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
finally:
    file.close()
    print("File has been closed.")`
```
