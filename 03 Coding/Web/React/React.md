Feature-based organization with dedicated folders for components, pages, features, hooks, store, types, and utils
Reusable UI components (Button, Card, Header, Footer, Layout) built with TypeScript
Centralized state management using Zustand
Declarative routing with React Router v6
Path aliases for clean imports (@/components, @/pages, etc.)
📁 Project Structure
🚀 Ready to Use
The app includes:

Home page with hero section and club features
Projects page showcasing embedded systems projects
Responsive navigation with mobile-friendly header/footer
Testing setup with Vitest and Testing Library
Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
🛠️ Quick Start
🔧 Easy to Extend
Add new pages in src/pages/ and routes in App.tsx
Create reusable components in src/components/ui/

Define types in src/types/
Write tests alongside your components
The modular structure makes it simple to maintain, test, and scale as your club grows. You can now easily add team pages, event management, member profiles, and more following the established patterns!
