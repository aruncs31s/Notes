# Inversion Of Control IoC
is a design principle in which custom-written portions of a computer program receive the flow of control from an external source

IoC is the transfer of control of objects, object dependencies, and general application flow to a different component or part of the application. - [Source](https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/go/tutorials/dependency_injection_part_one/introduction/)
